This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moderate-Quality Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&amp;mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs), indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest, and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low-Quality Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained from observational studies. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose&amp;ndash;response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACP Process for Assigning Strength of Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strong Recommendation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that the benefit of the intervention outweighs the risk, or vice versa, and the panel has reached uniform consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weak Recommendation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that the benefit of the intervention equals the risk, or vice versa, and the panel has reached uniform or non-uniform consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The searches identified English-language studies between May 2008 and March 2014 that evaluated patients 18 and older with stage I/II breast cancer who received accelerated radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery. Due to the complexity of the topic and the length of time to the completion of the paper, the literature search was extended to March 2016. A total of 419 articles that included the following key words were identified: Breast neoplasms/radiotherapy, accelerated, balloon, brachytherapy, catheter, implant, implantation, interstitial, intraoperative, limited, partial, Savi, Contura, TARGIT, Intrabeam, Xoft, Clearbeam, IOERT, IORT, and Mobitron. The electronic searches were supplemented by hand searches and articles suggested by the chair. The search ultimately yielded 19 randomized trials, 24 prospective studies, and 1 meta-analysis, all of which were abstracted into literature tables and made available to the task force during discussions. Retrospective studies were also discussed and cited when they provided novel information relevant to the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The work group included three coauthors of the original Consensus Statement, a breast cancer expert not involved in the initial Consensus Statement, and three members of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines subcommittee. After a review of the literature, the work group recommended a partial update of the Consensus Statement including: (1) revising the inclusion criteria of the &quot;suitable&quot; and &quot;cautionary&quot; patient groups, with regard to age, margins, and pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); and (2) creating a new key question regarding the use intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for partial breast irradiation (PBI) in early-stage breast cancer outside of a clinical trial. Other aspects of the prior guideline were felt to still be current and thus not in need of updating. The work group also proposed adding two IORT experts: a surgeon and a radiation oncologist. In January 2015, the ASTRO Board of Directors approved the proposal to partially update the Consensus Statement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Through a series of communications by conference calls and emails between March 2015 and May 2016, the task force, with ASTRO staff support, completed the systematic review, created literature tables, and formulated the recommendation statements and narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Grading of Evidence and Recommendations and Consensus Methodology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The task force consensus on the statements was evaluated through a modified Delphi approach. The task force members independently rated their agreement with each recommendation on a five-point Likert scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree using an electronic survey. A pre-specified threshold of greater than or equal to 75% &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;strongly agree&quot; responses indicated consensus was achieved. A total of four survey rounds, with revision as needed after each survey, were conducted to ascertain consensus on all the recommendation statements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For each statement, the strength of the recommendation was rated using the American College of Physicians (ACP) process for Assigning Strength of Recommendation and Grading of Quality of Evidence (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; and &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; fields). In determining recommendation strength, balance of risks and benefits was assessed. The chair initially assigned the ratings, which the task force later approved. A strong recommendation was defined as the benefit of the intervention outweighs the risk, or vice versa, with uniform consensus. A weak recommendation was defined as the benefit of the intervention equals the risk, or vice versa, with uniform or non-uniform consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

    <Field FieldID="153" OrdBy="710" ID="429" Name="Potential Harms" Type="text">
      <FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Adverse effects are different after intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) compared with whole breast irradiation (WBI). In the available trials, fat necrosis was increased with IORT, while skin side effects were lower. Mild breast fibrosis occurred with electron beam radiation on ELIOT, with no significant difference compared to WBI in the ELIOT trial. IORT techniques may allow improved critical organ sparing compared to WBI. Lung fibrosis in the ELIOT trial and deaths from cardiovascular causes in the TARGIT trial were lower in the IORT groups. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;In some studies, breast fibrosis was problematic for the combination of low-energy x-rays followed by WBI. For example, the use of low-energy x-ray IORT followed by WBI, compared to WBI alone, was associated with double the risk of breast fibrosis (to 37.5%), increased patient-reported pain, and decreased patient-reported quality of life. In contrast, other studies have reported outcomes with IORT followed by WBI that appear acceptable and comparable to either WBI alone or WBI with a conventional external beam boost. As such, the task force felt that the combination of IORT and WBI should be used only with caution and limited to women with higher risk features on final pathology. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Several key studies have provided important new data on the complication profile of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered with external beam radiation therapy (3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy [3D-CRT]) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Although the IBTR risk has not yet been reported, cosmetic outcome as assessed separately by patients, nurses, and physician panels was consistently worse at 3 and 5 years in patients randomized to 3D-CRT APBI. Single-arm studies have also reported higher rates of fair-poor cosmetic outcomes in approximately 20% of patients treated with EBRT-based APBI, while other clinical series of APBI delivered with 3D-CRT or IMRT reported acceptable cosmetic outcomes. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
