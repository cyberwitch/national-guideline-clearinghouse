(&lt;strong&gt;Strength of recommendation: Strong; Quality of evidence: Very low&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remarks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;There may be both legal and policy barriers to the access and use of naloxone by lay first responders, which may need to be reviewed in order to implement this recommendation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;In addition to the use of naloxone, emergency care of suspected opioid overdose should include ventilation support, airway management and management of withdrawal effects (specific emergency-care measures are described in Recommendation 3). While comprehensive training in opioid overdose and resuscitation is desirable, basic training can enable the effective emergency use of naloxone and the lack of more extensive training should not impede its use in the community. There are many training programmes available reflecting local contexts and needs. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The panel notes that the people at risk of overdose and those likely to witness an overdose may vary according to the local context (see examples in the table below). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Access to naloxone implies that the price remains affordable. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) made a strong recommendation for the use of naloxone based on current prices but note that this could change if prices rise drastically. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision on Strength of Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG determined that this recommendation should be strong despite the very low quality evidence due to the life-saving nature of the intervention and the apparent absence of significant harm. The panel also noted that this is a feasible intervention, highly valued by those at risk of opioid overdose and those likely to witness an opioid overdose in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table: Examples of People at Higher Risk of Overdose and People Likely to Witness an Overdose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; summary=&quot;Table: Examples of People at Higher Risk of Overdose and People Likely to Witness an Overdose&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;People at higher risk of overdose&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;People with opioid dependence, in particular those with reduced tolerance (following detoxification, release from incarceration, cessation of treatment) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;People who inject opioids &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;People who use prescription opioids, in particular those on higher doses &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;People who use opioids in combination with other sedating substances &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Opioid users with other significant medical conditions (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], liver or lung disease, depression) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Household members of people in possession of strong opioids &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;            &lt;/td&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;People likely to witness an overdose&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;People at risk of an opioid overdose, their friends and families &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;People whose work brings them into contact with people who overdose (health care workers, police, emergency service workers, people providing accommodation to people who use drugs, peer education and outreach workers) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;            &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;            &lt;/td&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Recommendation 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naloxone is effective when delivered by intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC) and intranasal routes of administration. Persons using naloxone should select a route of administration based on the formulation available, their skills in administration, the setting and local context. (&lt;strong&gt;Strength of recommendation: Conditional; Quality of evidence: Very low&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remarks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Route of Administration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The GDG recognizes that the IV route is appropriate and effective in medical settings. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Parenteral use of naloxone (IV, IM, SC) requires sterile injection equipment. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The capacity of the nasal mucosa to absorb liquids is limited, so if the intranasal route of administration is to be used, concentrated forms of naloxone should ideally be used. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The GDG has made this recommendation fully aware that the intranasal route is currently an off-label (non-licensed) route. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Affordability may dictate the preferred route in particular contexts. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dosage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The choice of initial dose will depend on the formulation of naloxone to be used and the context.&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;In medical settings dose selection is not generally an issue as dose titration is standard practice. In non-medical settings dose titration is not so easily accomplished and higher initial doses may be desirable. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The context also dictates the total amount of naloxone made available to non-medical responders. More than one dose may need to be available in a non-medical setting. The initial dose should be 0.4 mg&amp;ndash;2 mg, targeting recovery of breathing. In most cases 0.4&amp;ndash;0.8 mg is an effective dose. It is important to provide sufficient naloxone to supplement the initial dose, as necessary. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Intranasal delivery may require a higher dose. It should be noted that the commonly used method of intranasal administration is to spray 1 ml of the 1 mg/ml formulation of naloxone into each nostril with an atomizer connected to a syringe. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Where possible, efforts should be made to tailor the dose to avoid marked opioid withdrawal symptoms. The GDG notes that higher initial doses above 0.8 mg IM/IV/SC are more likely to precipitate significant withdrawal symptoms. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A more complicated situation arises where there has been an overdose of a combination of drugs. In this situation naloxone is still beneficial for reversing the opioid intoxication component of the overdose. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;It is essential that expert professional assistance be sought as soon as possible. Even in the case of opioid overdose, a person may not respond to naloxone if other drugs have been taken. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision on Strength of Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG decided to make this a conditional recommendation because, while there was certainty that the benefits outweighed the harms and that the end-users favoured this recommendation, there was uncertainty about the costs of intranasal naloxone, as this is currently an &quot;off-label&quot; use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Recommendation 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In suspected opioid overdose, first responders should focus on airway management, assisting ventilation and administering naloxone. (&lt;strong&gt;Strength of recommendation: Strong; Quality of evidence&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;: Very low&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remarks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the key feature of opioid overdose is respiratory arrest, ventilation is a priority. While recognizing there are different protocols in different parts of the world, the GDG suggests the following steps in resuscitating an individual with suspected opioid overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Apply vigorous stimulation&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, check and clear airway, and check respiration &amp;ndash; look for chest rising and falling. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;In the presence of vomit, seizures or irregular breathing, turn the patient on their side, and, if necessary, clear the airway of vomit. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;In the absence of regular breathing provide rescue ventilation and administer naloxone. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If there are no signs of life, commence chest compressions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Re-administer naloxone after two to three minutes if necessary. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;In all cases call for professional assistance. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Monitor the person until professional help arrives. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Where available, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) mouth barriers should be used for rescue ventilation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision on Strength of Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG determined that the recommendation should be strong despite the very low quality of the evidence because of the life-saving nature of CPR, including rescue breathing, in suspected opioid overdose in the community, and the low likelihood of resuscitation-induced harm. The panel also noted the feasibility of, and strong preferences in favour of CPR, including rescue breathing, expressed both by those at risk of overdose and those likely to witness an opioid overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The quality of evidence refers to the clinical trial evidence on the key question (comparing different approaches to resuscitation in opioid overdose) rather than the clinical trial evidence for resuscitation &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The most common way of applying vigorous physical stimulation to someone who is not responding to verbal stimulation is to rub the person's sternum (breast bone) with one's knuckles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Recommendation 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After successful resuscitation following the administration of naloxone, the affected person should have their level of consciousness and breathing closely observed until they have fully recovered. (&lt;strong&gt;Strength of recommendation: Strong; Quality of evidence: Very low&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remarks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;This recommendation is made with knowledge of the extended duration of opioid overdose, especially with the variety of longer-acting opioids and opioid formulations in current usage. It is critical to appreciate that the witness cannot tell what the length of action will be without observing the person who has overdosed. It is important to increase awareness of the need to remain with the person who has overdosed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Ideally, observation should be performed by properly-trained professionals. This applies particularly where the overdose is due to the use of long-acting opioids. The period of observation needed to ensure full recovery is at least two hours, following overdose from short-acting opioids such as heroin. It may be longer where a longer acting opioid has been consumed. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If a person relapses into opioid overdose, further naloxone administration may be required. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The definition of &quot;fully recovered&quot; is a return to pre-overdose levels of consciousness two hours after the last dose of naloxone. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;After the overdose has been reversed, the person who has overdosed should be reminded not to use opioids and other drugs that will interfere with their recovery from the overdose. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;It is important to ensure that the person who is resuscitated understands what happened and the risks of what might happen next. It should also be recognized that this is &quot;a teachable moment&quot; &amp;ndash; an opportunity to offer discussion of a range of treatment options and to train the person in the prevention and management of any future overdoses. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision on Strength of Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG determined that this should be a strong recommendation despite the low quality of evidence due to the ethical barriers to testing this with randomized control trials. The GDG is aware that the short half-life of naloxone, coupled with difficulty ascertaining the dose and type of opioid taken, means that naloxone may cease to be effective before the person has fully recovered but the simple nature of the proposed intervention is unlikely to result in any harm, and the willingness of people likely to witness an overdose to remain with people who have overdosed is documented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group Grades of Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High quality&lt;/strong&gt;: Further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate quality&lt;/strong&gt;: Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low quality&lt;/strong&gt;: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very low quality&lt;/strong&gt;: The Guideline Development Group is very uncertain about the estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength of Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong&lt;/strong&gt;: The Guideline Development Group (GDG) was confident that the evidence of effect, combined with certainty about the values, preferences, benefits and feasibility, made this a recommendation that should be applied in most circumstances and settings. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditional&lt;/strong&gt;: There was less certainty about the evidence of effect and values, preferences, benefits and feasibility of this recommendation. Thus there may be circumstances or settings in which the recommendation does not apply. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Where there was no effect size or studies could not be assessed using GRADEpro a narrative summary of the evidence was provided (see summaries in Annexes 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the original guideline document).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the evidence retrieved was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. GRADE evidence profiles were developed for each key question, summarizing the quality of the evidence, a narrative assessment of benefits versus risks and harms, the estimated values and preferences of those who might be affected by the guidelines, and the costs, resource utilization and feasibility of the proposed interventions. Where necessary, these narrative descriptions also referred to other relevant evidence, not included in the systematic reviews, including one interrupted time-series analysis and 20 case series of programmes that had distributed naloxone, and five case series of opioid overdose recovery after naloxone. The characteristics of these studies and relevant outcomes are presented in Annexes 2&amp;ndash;5 in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An online survey was conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess the values and preferences of those affected by the guidelines. This was completed by 661 respondents from 45 countries, including people at risk of opioid overdose, people with family members or friends who have overdosed or are at risk of opioid overdose, and people whose work brings them into contact with people who have experienced overdose and people at risk of overdose. A separate survey of 32 key informants was conducted by a consultant to the Department of HIV/AIDS, as part of a survey on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention, testing, treatment, harm reduction and community distribution of naloxone (see Annex 6 in the original guideline document for a detailed extract from the survey).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

A full list of members, their affiliations, expertise and countries is provided in Annex 7 of the original guideline document. Observers representing people at risk of opioid overdose and other stakeholder groups attended the GDG meeting in Geneva in February 2014, provided comments and technical information but did not participate in formulation of the recommendations. A full list of observers who attended the meeting and their affiliations is available in 'Acknowledgements' on page 5 in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG was supported by several consultants, three who performed the systematic reviews and provided all background documentation, and a fourth who advised on WHO guideline development methodology. A Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodologist reviewed the findings of the systematic review and developed the GRADE evidence profile (see Annex 8 in the original guideline document for details).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The External Review Group, whose members were drawn from people who may be affected by the guidance and people with content expertise, assessed all the evidence profiles and draft recommendations. The systematic reviewers and GDG considered their comments when finalizing the recommendations. A full list of external reviewers, their affiliations, countries, and expertise is provided in Annex 7 in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Guidelines Were Developed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These guidelines were developed in accordance with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field), and the process was overseen by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee. Development of the guidelines began in October 2013 with the establishment of the WHO Steering Group and the GDG which identified the key questions on which advice was needed. These questions were then formulated in PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, outcome). The GDG selected a list of outcomes for each PICO question and then ranked these by importance on a scale from 1 to 9. A ranking of 7&amp;ndash;9 was considered 'critical', 4&amp;ndash;6 'important' and 1&amp;ndash;3 'not important'. Only critical and important outcomes were considered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the exception of the values-and-preferences survey and key-informant results, the GRADE profiles were circulated for external review prior to the face-to-face meeting of the GDG.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The guideline development meeting, held in Geneva (19&amp;ndash;20 February 2014), was attended by GDG members and observers from organizations working with or representing people who use drugs, relevant professional societies, concerned government health agencies, intergovernmental organizations and WHO collaborating centres. Materials presented included GRADE evidence profiles, evidence summaries and systematic reviews, along with background documentation and findings from the values-and-preferences survey and key-informant interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A GRADE decision table was used to guide the determination of the strength of each recommendation (strong or conditional), based on the quality of the evidence, whether benefits outweighed harms, whether values and preferences of guideline end-users favoured the recommendation, and whether or not the recommendation was feasible and cost-effective (see Annexes 2&amp;ndash;5 in the original guideline document for the decision tables).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the meeting, the GDG agreed that decisions on the strength and wording of recommendations would preferably be reached by consensus &amp;ndash; defined as a state where all members of the GDG agree with the wording of recommendations and accompanying comments. It was further agreed that when unanimous agreement could not be achieved, an open vote would be held and decisions carried by a simple majority (more than 50%). In the meeting, the wording of all recommendations was agreed by consensus, and voting was not required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While discussing the recommendations, the GDG recommended that the scope of the guidelines be limited to pre-hospital care, enabling the guideline to be better targeted to opioid overdose in the community setting. This meant that several of the questions were no longer within the scope of the guideline and were therefore not discussed further at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Approximately 20% of doses distributed in observational studies are reported to be used. Naloxone was used in approximately 70% of the overdoses witnessed by laypersons provided with take-home naloxone. However, the panel noted that while naloxone is currently affordable, there is a possibility that new formulations targeted for community use will be developed, and that should the price rise considerably this may be a less cost-effective intervention. The panel noted the lack of analyses or modelling studies to guide assessment of the cost-effectiveness of take-home naloxone programmes for people using prescribed opioids. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The panel judged the costs associated with the various routes of administration to be currently low, noting some uncertainty of the pricing of specifically designed products for lay administration currently under development. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please refer to Annexes 2&amp;ndash;5 in the original guideline document for more information regarding resource use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
