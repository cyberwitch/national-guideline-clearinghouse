Wider searching may have resulted in additional trials being identified although the ERG accepts that the usefulness of data from these trials may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For all databases, a combination of free text and index terms were used, the intention being to limit the search to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) published in English after 2002. It is not clear from the MS why searches were limited to publications from 2002 onwards. Searches included 'any of the interventions licensed for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC'. Free text words for both generic and brand names of drugs were used. The ERG notes that search terms included a greater number of drugs than specified in the final scope issued by NICE. The ERG notes that the searches were conducted in March 2012 and have not been updated subsequently. The manufacturer's rationale for not updating the searches was that no major trials have been published since (other than those relating to afatinib identified by the manufacturer's clinical experts). While accepting that clinical experts may be aware of major trials, the ERG believes that searches should have been updated in order to minimise risk of retrieval bias. The manufacturer conducted a supplementary search using the terms 'EGFR mutation NSCLC' and the same databases. This search aimed to identify systematic reviews of studies of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive patients published after March 2012 and, according to the manufacturer's response to the ERG as part of the clarification process, was carried out on 6 August 2013. No further details were available for this search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, despite some limitations as outlined above, the ERG considers that the search strategies employed by the manufacturer were appropriate and sufficiently comprehensive to identify relevant studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusion Criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion criteria used in the systematic reviews is summarised in Table 4 of the ERG report. The ERG notes that in addition to the eligibility criteria specified in the tables, studies were also limited to the first-line setting (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ERG Comment on Manufacturer's Review of Cost-effectiveness Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective of the Manufacturer's Cost-effectiveness Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EMBASE, Medline &amp;amp; Medline In-process, and EconLit were searched via the OVID platform whilst the Cochrane Library was searched via the InterScience platform.

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by Liverpool Reviews &amp;amp; Implementation Group (LRiG) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of the Methods of Review(s)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quality Assessment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer conducted a quality assessment of three studies of afatinib, two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (LUX-Lung 3, LUX-Lung 6) and a single-arm phase II study (LUX-Lung 2) and all studies included in a mixed treatment comparison (MTC). This included elements of the tool for assessing risk of bias, as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. The ERG agrees this is an appropriate tool for assessing quality of RCTs. No other trials were included in the systematic review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evidence Synthesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two trials (LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6) were identified by the systematic review, both with different comparators (pemetrexed/cisplatin and gemcitabine/cisplatin). If it is assumed that these two comparators are of equal efficacy, then it may have been appropriate to have conducted a meta-analysis. However, as noted in Section 2.2 of the ERG report, there is evidence that pemetrexed/cisplatin is superior to gemcitabine/cisplatin in non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore the findings were appropriately presented narratively. Thus in order to compare afatinib to comparators of interest (erlotinib and gefitinib) it was necessary to conduct a MTC. See Section 4.3 of the ERG report for more information, including the ERG's critique of the manufacturer's MTC (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of Direct Evidence of Clinical Effectiveness Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identified Studies in the Systematic Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The systematic review identified two studies (both phase III trials; LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6 comparing afatinib with chemotherapy. In addition to evidence from these two RCTs, data from a single-arm study, LUX-Lung 2 was also considered relevant to the decision problem. The ERG is not aware of any additional completed studies of afatinib relevant to this appraisal although it is noted that there is an ongoing phase IIb trial comparing afatinib with gefitinib (LUX-Lung 7). This trial is enrolling 316 patients from Australia, Canada, Asia (China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan) and Europe (France, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK). The estimated study completion date for this trial is December 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quality Assessment of the Trials Included in the Systematic Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer conducted a quality assessment of the included studies. This included elements of the tool for assessing risk of bias, as recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6 were deemed to be of good quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results of the Trials Included in the Systematic Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Progression-free survival (PFS) data for LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6 are reproduced in Table 6 in the ERG report. The primary analysis in both trials was based on central independent assessments. Median PFS is reported to be similar for local and central independent assessment in LUX-Lung 3. However, in LUX-Lung 6 local assessment estimated the difference in median PFS time between afatinib and chemotherapy arms to be 8.18 months, considerably higher than the 5.42 months estimated by central independent assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6 the manufacturer provides forest plots, pre-specified in the protocol, for key subgroup analyses of PFS based on central independent assessment. Subgroups include (but are not limited to) age, gender, ethnicity, types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and smoking status and are summarised in Appendix 22.1.3 of the ERG report. The findings of subgroup analysis are consistent with those of the PFS primary analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In response to the ERG's request as part of the clarification process for findings to be presented for Asian and non-Asian patients, the manufacturer presented a subgroup analysis of local investigator assessed PFS in LUX-Lung 3 as summarised in Table 7 in the ERG report. This exploratory analysis suggests that Asian patients may have improved PFS compared with non-Asian patients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall survival (OS) data presented by the manufacturer are not mature for either LUX-Lung 3 or LUX-Lung 6 as in neither trial, the planned number of events (deaths) to assess OS have not occurred. Most recent OS data for both trials are summarised in Table 8 in the ERG report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ERG Analysis of OS and PFS Data from LUX-Lung-3 Clinical Trial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ERG requested detailed information from the manufacturer of afatinib in the form of Kaplan-Meier survival analyses for OS, PFS and post-progression survival (PPS) distinguishing between two subgroups: those of Asian origin and those of non-Asian origin. The aim of this exercise was to determine whether there is evidence that the experience of patients in responding to treatment differed by ethnic origin, and whether alternative projective model formulations may represent more accurately the trial results than the Weibull functions employed by the manufacturer in the submitted model. The analysis was carried out for PFS and OS, but the number of patients and events in the PPS dataset proved to be inadequate for meaningful analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The requested survival analyses involved use of the most recent data update, and a different censoring rule (censoring at time of data cut, not of last observation) to remove bias from informative censoring. It is important to note that origin (Asian vs non-Asian) is a stratification variable for this clinical trial, so that analyses using these subgroups should be free of biases inherent in post-hoc exploratory subgroup analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of Indirect Evidence of Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methodological Approach to MTC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The MTC used a Bayesian approach and was performed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo software package WinBUGs. This approach combines a prior probability distribution with a likelihood distribution. The prior distribution reflects a prior belief of the possible values of the pooled relative effects of the pooled effect. The likelihood distribution is based on observed data in different studies to obtain a posterior distribution of the pooled relative treatment effect. The manufacturer performed MTCs for three outcomes; PFS, OS and adverse effects. The metrics used in the MTC for OS and PFS were log hazard ratios and standard error.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 4 of the ERG report for more information on clinical effectiveness analysis (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary and Critique of Manufacturer's Submitted Economic Evaluation by the ERG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model compares afatinib monotherapy with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in a first-line setting. No comparison is made between afatinib and chemotherapy. No economic modelling been carried out to support the use of afatinib as a second-line treatment. However, the manufacturer reports that results from LUX-Lung 2 showed no significant difference in objective response rate in patients receiving afatinib as a first-line treatment (40/61 patients [66%]) and those receiving second-line treatment (39/68 [57%]; Odds ratio 0.71, 0.35 to 1.44). Although the manufacturer recognises that this trial was not powered to detect differences between the two groups they suggest that if afatinib is cost effective compared with gefitinib and erlotinib as a first-line treatment, and outcomes for first and second-line patients receiving afatinib are similar then, if afatinib were compared with gefitinib and erlotinib second-line incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) would be similar. The manufacturer recognises that this would require the additional assumption that gefitinib and erlotinib were equally efficacious in second-line as in first-line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the ERG report for additional information on the manufacturer's submitted economic evaluation (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

This means that, if a patient has epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that afatinib is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The Department of Health and the manufacturer have agreed that afatinib will be available to the NHS with a patient access scheme which makes afatinib available with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to communicate details of the discount to the relevant NHS organisations. Any enquiries from NHS organisations about the patient access scheme should be directed to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:onccommercial.bra@boehringer-ingelheim.com&quot;&gt;onccommercial.bra@boehringer-ingelheim.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;NICE has developed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta310/resources/lung-cancer-non-small-cell-egfr-mutation-positive-afatinib-costing-statement&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;costing statement&lt;/a&gt; (see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) explaining the resource impact of this guidance to help organisations put this guidance into practice. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
