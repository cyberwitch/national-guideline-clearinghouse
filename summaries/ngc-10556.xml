Monitor mood and if there are signs of hypomania or deterioration of the depressive symptoms, liaise with or refer the person to secondary care. If the person develops mania or severe depression, refer them urgently to secondary care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychological therapists working with people with bipolar depression in primary care should have training in and experience of working with people with bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not start lithium to treat bipolar disorder in primary care for people who have not taken lithium before, except under shared-care arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not start valproate in primary care to treat bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If bipolar disorder is managed solely in primary care, re-refer to secondary care if any one of the following applies:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;There is a poor or partial response to treatment &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The person's functioning declines significantly &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Treatment adherence is poor &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The person develops intolerable or medically important side effects from medication &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Comorbid alcohol or drug misuse is suspected &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The person is considering stopping any medication after a period of relatively stable mood &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A woman with bipolar disorder is pregnant or planning a pregnancy &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring Physical Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Develop and use practice case registers to monitor the physical and mental health of people with bipolar disorder in primary care.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Monitor the physical health of people with bipolar disorder when responsibility for monitoring is transferred from secondary care, and then at least annually. The health check should be comprehensive, including all the checks recommended below and focusing on physical health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and respiratory disease. A copy of the results should be sent to the care coordinator and psychiatrist, and put in the secondary care records.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that the physical health check for people with bipolar disorder, performed at least annually, includes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Weight or body mass index (BMI), diet, nutritional status and level of physical activity &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular status, including pulse and blood pressure &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Metabolic status, including fasting blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA&lt;sub&gt;1c&lt;/sub&gt;) and blood lipid profile &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Liver function &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Renal and thyroid function, and calcium levels, for people taking long-term lithium &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Identify people with bipolar disorder who have hypertension, have abnormal lipid levels, are obese or at risk of obesity, have diabetes or are at risk of diabetes (as indicated by abnormal blood glucose levels), or are physically inactive, at the earliest opportunity.

The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally the GDG uses 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&amp;hellip;') are used when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions That Could Be Used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: This guideline was developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH) on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Review Protocols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Review questions drafted during the scoping phase were discussed by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) at the first few meetings and amended as necessary. The review questions were used as the starting point for developing review protocols for each systematic review. Where appropriate, the review questions were refined once the evidence had been searched and, where necessary, sub-questions were generated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For questions about interventions, the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome) framework was used to structure each question (see Table 2 in the full version of the original guideline document).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions relating to diagnosis or case identification do not involve an intervention designed to treat a particular condition, and therefore the PICO framework was not used. Rather, the questions were designed to pick up key issues specifically relevant to clinical utility, for example their accuracy, reliability, safety and acceptability to the service user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To help facilitate the literature review, a note was made of the best study design type to answer each question. There are four main types of review question of relevance to NICE guidelines. These are listed in Table 3 in the full version of the original guideline document. For each type of question, the best primary study design varies, where 'best' is interpreted as 'least likely to give misleading answers to the question'. For questions about the effectiveness of interventions, where randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were not available, the review of other types of evidence was pursued only if there was reason to believe that it would help the GDG to formulate a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in all cases, a well-conducted systematic review (of the appropriate type of study) is likely to always yield a better answer than a single study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clinical Review Methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the clinical literature review was to systematically identify and synthesise relevant evidence from the literature in order to answer the specific review questions developed by the GDG. Thus, clinical practice recommendations are evidence-based, where possible, and, if evidence is not available, informal consensus methods are used to try and reach general agreement between GDG members and the need for future research is specified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Search Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scoping Searches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A broad preliminary search of the literature was undertaken in August 2011 to obtain an overview of the issues likely to be covered by the scope, and to help define key areas. Searches were restricted to clinical guidelines, Health Technology Assessment (HTA) reports, key systematic reviews and RCTs. A list of databases and websites searched can be found in Appendix 8 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Systematic Literature Searches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the scope was finalised, a systematic search strategy was developed to locate as much relevant evidence as possible. The balance between sensitivity (the power to identify all studies on a particular topic) and specificity (the ability to exclude irrelevant studies from the results) was carefully considered, and a decision made to utilise a broad approach to most of the searches to maximise retrieval of evidence to all parts of the guideline. Searches were restricted to certain study designs if specified in the review protocol, and conducted in the following databases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;CENTRAL &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;EMBASE &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;HTA database (technology assessments) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;MEDLINE/MEDLINE In-Process &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategies were initially developed for MEDLINE before being translated for use in other databases/interfaces. Strategies were built up through a number of trial searches and discussions of the results of the searches with the review team and the GDG to ensure that all possible relevant search terms were covered. The search terms for each search are set out in full in Appendix 8 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reference Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Citations from each search were downloaded into reference management software and duplicates removed. Records were then screened against the eligibility criteria of the reviews before being appraised for methodological quality. The unfiltered search results were saved and retained for future potential re-analysis to help keep the process both replicable and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search Filters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To aid retrieval of relevant and sound studies, filters were used to limit a number of searches to randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews. Both of these search filters are adaptations of filters designed by the Health Information Research Unit of McMaster University. Each filter comprises index terms relating to the study type(s) and associated text words for the methodological description of the design(s).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Date and Language Restrictions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systematic database searches were initially conducted in July 2012 up to the most recent searchable date. Search updates were generated on a 6-monthly basis, with the final re-runs carried out in January 2014 ahead of the guideline consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After this point, studies were only included if they were judged by the GDG to be exceptional (for example, if the evidence was likely to change a recommendation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although no language restrictions were applied at the searching stage, foreign language papers were not requested or reviewed, unless they were of particular importance to a review question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For review questions that update Bipolar disorder (NICE clinical guideline 38), searching was limited to updating pre-existing reviews, covering the time period since the searches for the published reviews were conducted. For new review questions, no date restriction was imposed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Search Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other search methods involved: (a) scanning the reference lists of all eligible publications (systematic reviews, stakeholder evidence and included studies) for more published reports and citations of unpublished research; (b) sending lists of studies meeting the inclusion criteria to subject experts (identified through searches and the GDG) and asking them to check the lists for completeness, and to provide information of any published or unpublished research for consideration (see Appendix 6 in the full version of the original guideline document and &quot;Unpublished Evidence,&quot; below); (c) contacting included study authors for unpublished or incomplete datasets. Searches conducted for existing NICE guidelines were updated where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Full details of the search strategies and filters used for the systematic review of clinical evidence are provided in Appendix 8 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study Selection and Assessment of Methodological Quality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All primary-level studies included after the first scan of citations were acquired in full and re-evaluated for eligibility at the time they were being entered into the study information database. More specific eligibility criteria were developed for each review question and are described in the relevant clinical evidence chapters. The eligibility of each study was confirmed by at least one member of the GDG.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some review questions, it was necessary to prioritise the evidence with respect to the UK context (that is, external validity). To make this process explicit, the GDG took into account the following factors when assessing the evidence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Participant factors (for example, gender, age and ethnicity) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Provider factors (for example, model fidelity, the conditions under which the intervention was performed and the availability of experienced staff to undertake the procedure) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cultural factors (for example, differences in standard care and differences in the welfare system) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was the responsibility of the GDG to decide which prioritisation factors were relevant to each review question in light of the UK context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unpublished Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders, authors and principle investigators were approached for unpublished evidence (see Appendices 4 and 6 in the full version of the original guideline document). The GDG used a number of criteria when deciding whether or not to accept unpublished data. First, the evidence must have been accompanied by a trial report containing sufficient detail to properly assess risk of bias. Second, the evidence must have been submitted with the understanding that data from the study and a summary of the study's characteristics would be published in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Health Economics Methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Strategy for Economic Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scoping Searches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A broad preliminary search of the literature was undertaken in August 2011 to obtain an overview of the issues likely to be covered by the scope, and help define key areas. Searches were restricted to economic studies and HTA reports, and conducted in the following databases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;EMBASE &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;MEDLINE/MEDLINE In-Process &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;HTA database (technology assessments) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any relevant economic evidence arising from the clinical scoping searches was also made available to the health economist during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Systematic Literature Searches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the scope was finalised, a systematic search strategy was developed to locate as much relevant evidence as possible. The balance between sensitivity (the power to identify all studies on a particular topic) and specificity (the ability to exclude irrelevant studies from the results) was carefully considered, and a decision made to utilise a broad approach to most of the searches to maximise retrieval of evidence to all parts of the guideline. Searches were restricted to economic studies and health technology assessment reports, and conducted in the following databases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;EMBASE &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;HTA database (technology assessments) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;MEDLINE/MEDLINE In-Process &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;NHS EED &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;PsycINFO &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any relevant economic evidence arising from the clinical searches was also made available to the health economist during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategies were initially developed for MEDLINE before being translated for use in other databases/interfaces. Strategies were built up through a number of trial searches, and discussions of the results of the searches with the review team and GDG to ensure that all possible relevant search terms were covered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search terms are set out in full in Appendix 9 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reference Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Citations from each search were downloaded into reference management software and duplicates removed. Records were then screened against the inclusion criteria of the reviews before being quality appraised. The unfiltered search results were saved and retained for future potential re-analysis to help keep the process both replicable and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search Filters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search filter for health economics is an adaptation of a pre-tested strategy designed by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. The search filter is designed to retrieve records of economic evidence (including full and partial economic evaluations) from the vast amount of literature indexed to major medical databases such as MEDLINE. The filter, which comprises a combination of controlled vocabulary and free-text retrieval methods, maximises sensitivity (or recall) to ensure that as many potentially relevant records as possible are retrieved from a search. A full description of the filter is provided in Appendix 9 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Date and Language Restrictions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systematic database searches were initially conducted in July 2012 up to the most recent searchable date. Search updates were generated on a 6-monthly basis, with the final re-runs carried out in January 2014 ahead of the guideline consultation. After this point studies were included only if they were judged by the GDG to be exceptional (for example, the evidence was likely to change a recommendation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For review questions that update Bipolar disorder (NICE clinical guideline 38), searching was limited to updating pre-existing reviews, covering the time period since the searches for the published reviews were conducted. For new review questions, searches were restricted to research published from 1998 onwards in order to obtain data relevant to current healthcare settings and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Search Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other search methods involved scanning the reference lists of all eligible publications (systematic reviews, stakeholder evidence and included studies from the economic and clinical reviews) to identify further studies for consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Full details of the search strategies and filter used for the systematic review of health economic evidence are provided in Appendix 9 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusion Criteria for Economic Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following inclusion criteria were applied to select studies identified by the economic searches for further consideration:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Only studies from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries were included, as the aim of the review was to identify economic information transferable to the UK context. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Only studies published from 2003 onwards were included in the review. This date restriction was imposed so that retrieved economic evidence was relevant to current healthcare settings and costs. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Selection criteria based on types of clinical conditions and service users as well as interventions assessed were identical to the clinical literature review. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Studies were included provided that sufficient details regarding methods and results were available to enable the methodological quality of the study to be assessed, and provided that the study's data and results were extractable. Poster presentations and abstracts in conference proceedings were excluded. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Full economic evaluations that compared two or more relevant options and considered both costs and consequences were included in the review. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Economic studies were included if they used clinical effectiveness data from RCTs, prospective cohort studies, or systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical studies. Studies that had a mirror-image or other retrospective design were excluded from the review. Studies that utilised clinical effectiveness parameters based on expert opinion or assumptions were also excluded. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Studies were included only if the examined interventions were clearly described. This involved the dosage and route of administration and the duration of treatment in the case of pharmacological interventions; and the types of health professionals involved as well as the frequency and duration of treatment in the case of psychological interventions. Evaluations in which drugs were treated as a class were excluded from further consideration. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Studies that adopted a very narrow perspective, ignoring major categories of costs to the NHS, were excluded; for example studies that estimated exclusively drug acquisition costs or hospitalisation costs were considered non-informative to the guideline development process. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The abstracts of all potentially relevant studies (250 references) were then assessed against the inclusion criteria for economic evaluations by the health economist. Full texts of the studies potentially meeting the inclusion criteria (including those for which eligibility was not clear from the abstract) were obtained. Studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria, were duplicates, were secondary publications of one study, or had been updated in more recent publications were subsequently excluded. Economic evaluations eligible for inclusion (20 studies in 19 publications) were then appraised for their applicability and quality using the methodology checklist for economic evaluations. Finally, 17 publications reporting 18 economic analyses that fully or partially met the applicability and quality criteria were considered at formulation of the guideline recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: This guideline was developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH) on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clinical Review Methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Study characteristics, aspects of methodological quality, and outcome data were extracted from all eligible studies, using Microsoft Excel and Review Manager 5.2 (The Cochrane Collaboration).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The method used to synthesize evidence depended on the review question and availability and type of evidence (see below for full details). In the absence of high-quality research, an informal consensus process was used (see Section 3.5.6 in the full version of the original guideline document).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synthesising the Evidence from Test Accuracy Studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Meta-analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Review Manager was used to summarise test accuracy data from each study using forest plots and summary receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 3.5.2 in the full version of the original guideline document for discussions of sensitivity and specificity, ROC curves, negative and positive likelihood ratios, and heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synthesising the Evidence for the Effectiveness of Interventions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Pairwise Meta-analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where appropriate, meta-analysis was used to synthesise evidence for the effectiveness of interventions using Review Manager Version 5.2. If necessary, re-analyses of the data or sub-analyses were used to answer review questions not addressed in the original studies or reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dichotomous outcomes were analysed as relative risks (RR; also called a risk ratio) with the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) (see Figure 2 in the full version of the original guideline document for an example of a forest plot displaying dichotomous data).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Continuous outcomes were analysed using the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different measures were used in different studies to estimate the same underlying effect (see Figure 3 in the full version of the original guideline document for an example of a forest plot displaying continuous data). If reported by study authors, intention-to-treat (ITT) data, using a valid method for imputation of missing data, were preferred over data only from people who completed the study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Heterogeneity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To check for consistency of effects among studies, both the &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; statistic and the chi-squared test of heterogeneity, as well as a visual inspection of the forest plots were used. The &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; statistic describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. For meta-analyses of comparative effectiveness studies, the &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; statistic was interpreted in the following way based on guidelines from the Cochrane Collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;0% to 40%: might not be important &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Cochrane Collaboration advice suggests that overlapping categories are less misleading than simple thresholds since the importance of inconsistency depends on (1) the magnitude and direction of effects, and (2) the strength of evidence for heterogeneity (for example, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; value from the chi-squared test, or a CI for &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Network Meta-analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Standard models for network meta-analysis (NMA) with binary outcomes were used for two outcomes: a) discontinuation, and b) response given no discontinuation. Information on the log-odds ratio of response in trials reporting on more than one scale was combined and information on the standardised mean difference on different symptoms scales was used to inform the log-odds ratio of response. Baseline probabilities of discontinuation and response given no discontinuation were calculated based on all trials with a Placebo arm reporting these outcomes. Further information about the method used and the winBUGS code can be found in Appendix 15 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading the Quality of Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For questions about the effectiveness of interventions, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to grade the quality of evidence for each outcome. For questions about the experience of care and the organisation and delivery of care, methodology checklists were used to assess the risk of bias, and this information was taken into account when interpreting the evidence. The technical team produced GRADE evidence profiles using GRADEprofiler (GRADEpro) software (Version 3.6), following advice set out in the GRADE handbook.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evidence Profiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A GRADE evidence profile was used to summarise both the quality of the evidence and the results of the evidence synthesis for each &quot;critical&quot; outcome. The GRADE approach is based on a sequential assessment of the quality of evidence, followed by judgment about the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and subsequent decision about the strength of a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within the GRADE approach to grading the quality of evidence, the following is used as a starting point:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)&amp;nbsp;without important limitations provide high quality evidence &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Observational studies without special strengths or important limitations provide low quality evidence &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For each outcome, quality may be reduced depending on five factors: limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. For the purposes of the guideline, each factor was evaluated using criteria provided in Table 4 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For observational studies without any reasons for down-grading, the quality may be up-graded if there is a large effect, all plausible confounding would reduce the demonstrated effect (or increase the effect if no effect was observed), or there is evidence of a dose-response gradient (details would be provided under the &quot;other&quot; column).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presenting Evidence to the Guideline Development Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Study characteristics tables and, where appropriate, forest plots generated with Review Manager Version 5.2 and GRADE summary of findings tables were presented to the GDG.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where meta-analysis was not appropriate and/or possible, the reported results from each primary-level study were reported in the study characteristics table and presented to the GDG. The range of effect estimates were included in the GRADE profile, and where appropriate, described narratively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary of Findings Tables&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summary of findings tables generated from GRADEpro were used to summarise the evidence for each outcome and the quality of that evidence. The tables provide illustrative comparative risks, especially useful when the baseline risk varies for different groups within the population.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extrapolation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When answering review questions, if there is no direct evidence from a primary dataset (defined as a data set which contains evidence on the population and intervention under review), based on the initial search for evidence, it may be appropriate to extrapolate from another data set. In this situation, the following principles were used to determine when to extrapolate:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A primary dataset is absent, of low quality or is judged to be not relevant to the review question under consideration, and &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A review question is deemed by the GDG to be important, such that in the absence of direct evidence, other data sources should be considered, and &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Non-primary data source(s) is in the view of the GDG available, which may inform the review question. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the decision to extrapolate was made, the following principles were used to inform the choice of the non-primary dataset:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The populations (usually in relation to the specified diagnosis or problem which characterises the population) under consideration share some common characteristic but differ in other ways, such as age, gender or in the nature of the disorder (for example, a common behavioural problem; acute versus chronic presentations of the same disorder), and &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The interventions under consideration in the view of the GDG have one or more of the following characteristics:&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Share a common mode of action (e.g., the pharmacodynamics of drug; a common psychological model of change - operant conditioning) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Be feasible to deliver in both populations (e.g., in terms of the required skills or the demands of the health care system) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Share common side effects/harms in both populations, and &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The context or comparator involved in the evaluation of the different datasets shares some common elements which support extrapolation, and &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The outcomes involved in the evaluation of the different datasets shares some common elements which support extrapolation (for example, improved mood or a reduction in challenging behaviour). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the choice of the non-primary dataset was made, the following principles were used to guide the application of extrapolation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The GDG should first consider the need for extrapolation through a review of the relevant primary dataset and be guided in these decisions by the principles for the use of extrapolation &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;In all areas of extrapolation datasets should be assessed against the principles for determining the choice of datasets. In general the criteria in the four principles set out above for determining the choice should be met &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;In deciding on the use of extrapolation, the GDG will have to determine if the extrapolation can be held to be reasonable, including ensuring that:&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The reasoning behind the decision can be justified by the clinical need for a recommendation to be made &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The absence of other more direct evidence, and by the relevance of the potential dataset to the review question can be established &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The reasoning and the method adopted is clearly set out in the relevant section of the guideline. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method Used to Answer a Review Question in the Absence of Appropriately Designed, High-Quality Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of appropriately designed, high-quality research (including indirect evidence where it would be appropriate to use extrapolation), an informal consensus process was adopted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The process involved a group discussion of what is known about the issues. The views of GDG were synthesised narratively by a member of the review team, and circulated after the meeting. Feedback was used to revise the text, which was then included in the appropriate evidence review chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Health Economic Methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the health economics was to contribute to the guideline's development by providing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of interventions for adults, children and young people with bipolar disorder covered in the guideline. This was achieved by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Systematic literature review of existing economic evidence &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Decision-analytic economic modelling &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systematic reviews of economic literature were conducted in all areas covered in the guideline. Economic modelling was undertaken in areas with likely major resource implications, where the current extent of uncertainty over cost-effectiveness was significant and economic analysis was expected to reduce this uncertainty, in accordance with &lt;em&gt;The Guidelines Manual&lt;/em&gt; (NICE, 2012). Prioritisation of areas for economic modelling was a joint decision between the Health Economist and the GDG. The rationale for prioritising review questions for economic modelling was set out in an economic plan agreed between NICE, the GDG, the Health Economist and the other members of the technical team. The following economic questions were selected as key issues that were addressed by economic modelling:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cost-effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for adults with bipolar disorder in a manic episode &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cost-effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for adults with bipolar disorder in an acute depressive episode &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cost-effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for the maintenance treatment of adults with bipolar disorder &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, literature on the health-related quality of life of people with bipolar disorder was systematically searched to identify studies reporting appropriate utility values that could be utilised in a cost-utility analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Methods employed in economic modelling are described in the relevant economic sections of the evidence chapters in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applicability and Quality Criteria for Economic Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All economic papers eligible for inclusion were appraised for their applicability and quality using the methodology checklist for economic evaluations recommended by NICE (NICE, 2012). The methodology checklist for economic evaluations was also applied to the economic models developed specifically for this guideline. All studies hat fully or partially met the applicability and quality criteria described in the methodology checklist were considered during the guideline development process, along with the results of the economic modelling conducted specifically for this guideline. The completed methodology checklists for all economic evaluations 9 considered in the guideline are provided in Appendix 31 in the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: This guideline was developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH) on behalf of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). See the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field for the full version of this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Guideline Development Group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the consultation phase, members of the Guideline Development Group (GDG) were appointed by an open recruitment process. GDG membership consisted of: professionals in psychiatry, clinical psychology, nursing, social work, and general practice; academic experts in psychiatry and psychology; and service users. The guideline development process was supported by staff from the NCCMH, who undertook the clinical and health economic literature searches, reviewed and presented the evidence to the GDG, managed the process, and contributed to drafting the guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guideline Development Group Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen GDG meetings were held between October 2012 and June 2014. During 30 each day-long GDG meeting, in a plenary session, review questions and clinical and economic evidence were reviewed and assessed and, at later meetings, recommendations formulated. At each meeting, all GDG members declared any potential conflicts of interest (see Appendix 2 in the full version of the original guideline document [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]), and service user and carer concerns were routinely discussed as a standing agenda item.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Users and Carers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with direct experience of services gave an integral service-user focus to the GDG and the guideline. The GDG included service users. They contributed as full GDG members to writing the review questions, providing advice on outcomes most relevant to service users and carers, helping to ensure that the evidence addressed their views and preferences, highlighting sensitive issues and terminology relevant to the guideline, and bringing service user research to the attention of the GDG. In drafting the guideline, they contributed to the chapter on experience of carers and to writing the guideline's introduction and identified recommendations from the service user and carer perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Advisors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Special advisors, who had specific expertise in one or more aspects of treatment and management relevant to the guideline, assisted the GDG, commenting on specific aspects of the developing guideline and making presentations to the GDG. Appendix 3 in the full version of the original guideline document lists those who agreed to act as special advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National and International Experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;National and international experts in the area under review were identified through the literature search and through the experience of the GDG members. These experts were contacted to identify unpublished or soon-to-be published studies, to ensure that up-to-date evidence was included in the development of the guideline. They informed the GDG about completed trials at the pre-publication stage, systematic reviews in the process of being published, studies relating to the cost effectiveness of treatment and trial data if the GDG could be provided with full access to the complete trial report. Appendix 6 in the full version of the original guideline document lists researchers who were contacted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Using NICE Evidence Reviews and Recommendations from Existing Guidelines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When review questions overlap and evidence from another guideline applies to a question in the current guideline, it might be desirable and practical to incorporate or adapt recommendations published in NICE guidelines. Adaptation refers to the process by which an existing recommendation is modified in order to facilitate its placement in a new guideline. Incorporation refers to the placement of a recommendation that was developed for another guideline into a new guideline, with no material changes to wording or structure. Incorporation would be used in relatively rare circumstances, as cross-referring to the other guideline will often be all that is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Incorporation or adaptation is likely to be substantially more complex where health economics were a major part of the decision making. In these circumstances, these methods are only used rarely after full and detailed consideration. Refer to the full version of the original guideline document for the criteria used for incorporation and adaptation in this guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In deciding whether to choose between incorporation or adaptation of existing guideline recommendations, the GDG considered whether the direct evidence obtained from the current guideline dataset was of sufficient quality to allow development of recommendations. It was only where (a) such evidence was not available or insufficient to draw robust conclusions and (b) where methods used in other NICE guidelines were sufficiently robust that the 'incorporate and adapt' method could be used. Recommendations were only incorporated or adapted after the GDG had reviewed evidence supporting previous recommendations and confirmed that they agreed with the original recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When adaptation is used, the meaning and intent of the original recommendation is preserved but the wording and structure of the recommendation may change. Preservation of the original meaning (that is, that the recommendation faithfully represents the assessment and interpretation of the evidence contained in the original guideline document evidence reviews) and intent (that is, the intended action[s] specified in the original recommendation will be achieved) is an essential element of the process of adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;From Evidence to Recommendations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the clinical and health economic evidence was summarised, the drafted the recommendations. In making recommendations, the GDG took into account the trade-off between the benefits and harms of the intervention/instrument, as well as other important factors, such as economic considerations, values of the GDG and society, the requirements to prevent discrimination and to promote equality, and the GDG's awareness of practical issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to show clearly how the GDG moved from the evidence to the recommendations, each chapter has a section called 'from evidence to recommendations'. Underpinning this section is the concept of the 'strength' of a recommendation. This takes into account the quality of the evidence but is conceptually different. Some recommendations are 'strong' in that the GDG believes that the vast majority of healthcare professionals and service users would choose a particular intervention if they considered the evidence in the same way that the GDG has. This is generally the case if the benefits clearly outweigh the harms for most people and the intervention is likely to be cost effective. However, there is often a closer balance between benefits and harms, and some service users would not choose an intervention whereas others would. This may happen, for example, if some service users are particularly averse to some side effect and others are not. In these circumstances the recommendation is generally weaker, although it may be possible to make stronger recommendations about specific groups of service users. The strength of each recommendation is reflected in the wording of the recommendation, rather than by using ratings, labels or symbols (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Recommendations&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The Guideline Development Group (GDG) makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GDG is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally the GDG uses 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer&amp;hellip;') are used when the GDG is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions That Could Be Used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Other side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, sexual dysfunction, extrapyramidal side effects (tremor, stiffness, restlessness, and abnormal movements) and dizziness. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Recently, there has been increasing concern about the possible metabolic side effects of second generation antipsychotics including elevation of glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticonvulsants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Valproate is associated with a number of side effects including tremor, weight gain, and rarely, liver damage. It can interact with a number of commonly prescribed medicines and notably is known to decrease plasma levels of olanzapine, an antipsychotic drug that is commonly prescribed in people with bipolar disorder. Valproate is a known major human teratogen. There are significant risks associated with taking valproate during pregnancy for the unborn child, including risk of autism and its use is best avoided completely in women of child-bearing age. Treatment with lithium and possibly valproate should not be stopped abruptly as&amp;nbsp;this has been associated with early relapse. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The main side effects associated with carbamazepine are dizziness, drowsiness, nausea and headaches, and it can cause a low white blood count, hyponatraemia (low level of sodium in the blood) and rarely, liver damage. Carbamazepine is a potent inducer of hepatic cytochrome enzymes and this can lead to increased metabolism so lower plasma levels of a number of commonly prescribed medicines. For example standard dose combined oral contraceptives can be rendered ineffective due to the increased metabolism of oestrogen. Carbamazepine is also a known human teratogen. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Lamotrigine is associated with rash which can be serious and to minimise the risk of this occurring, the dose of lamotrigine has to be increased very slowly at the start of treatment. Lamotrigine can also cause drowsiness, dizziness and blurred vision and it can depress the bone marrow. Lamotrigine too is a known human teratogen, although it is considerably safer in pregnancy than valproate. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Anticonvulsant drugs can interact with each other and if more than one of these drugs is prescribed, the British National Formulary (BNF) should be checked to ensure doses are adjusted if required. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antidepressants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most frequently prescribed antidepressants. These drugs are generally well tolerated although they can cause headache, gastrointestinal upset and sexual dysfunction. SSRIs can also cause hyponatraemia (low blood sodium) and they increase the risk of bleeds, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lithium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Lithium has adverse effects on the kidneys, thyroid and parathyroid. Lithium is a known human teratogen, that is, it is potentially harmful to an unborn child. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Lithium may be associated with an increased risk of reduced urinary concentrating ability (extent to which the kidneys are able to manufacture urine rich in dissolved wastes yet low in water), hormone disorders, and weight gain. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic range meaning that there is a small difference between a dose that is too low to be effective and one that is known to be toxic. Toxic levels of lithium cause a range of symptoms including confusion, neurological disorders, cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), and, as levels rise, further convulsions, coma and death. A number of commonly used medicines can increase the concentration in the blood and potentially lead to lithium toxicity. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Treatment with lithium and possibly valproate should not be stopped abruptly as&amp;nbsp;this has been associated with early relapse. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See the &quot;Trade-off between clinical benefits and harms&quot; sections in the full version of the original guideline document (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for harms of specific interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by the summaries of product characteristics of any drugs. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;This guideline recommends some drugs for indications for which they do not have a UK marketing authorisation at the date of publication, if there is good evidence to support that use. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. The patient (or those with authority to give consent on their behalf) should provide informed consent, which should be documented.

If someone does not have the capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reference-guide-to-consent-for-examination-or-treatment-second-edition&quot; title=&quot;UK Department of Health Web site&quot;&gt;Department of Health's advice on consent&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justice.gov.uk/protecting-the-vulnerable/mental-capacity-act&quot; title=&quot;UK Department of Justice Web site&quot;&gt;code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act&lt;/a&gt; and the supplementary &lt;a href=&quot;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_085476&quot; title=&quot;UK Department of Health Archive Web site&quot;&gt;code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;NICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS services. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG138&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;Patient experience in adult NHS services&lt;/a&gt; (NICE clinical guideline 138). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;NICE has also produced guidance on the components of good service user experience. All healthcare professionals and social care practitioners working with people using adult NHS mental health services should follow the recommendations in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG136&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;Service user experience in adult mental health&lt;/a&gt; (NICE clinical guideline 136). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If a young person is moving between paediatric and adult services, care should be planned and managed according to the best practice guidance described in the Department of Health's &lt;a href=&quot;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4132145&quot; title=&quot;UK National Archives Web site&quot;&gt;Transition: getting it right for young people&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Adult and paediatric healthcare teams should work jointly to provide assessment and services to young people with bipolar disorder. Diagnosis and management should be reviewed throughout the transition process, and there should be clarity about who is the lead clinician to ensure continuity of care. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
