Consider using the oral health assessment tool. Where family and friends are involved in ongoing care, consider involving them in the initial assessment, with the residents' permission, if it will help staff understand the resident's usual oral hygiene routine. Ask:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;How the resident usually manages their daily mouth care (for example, toothbrushing and type of toothbrush, removing and caring for dentures including partial dentures). Check whether they need support. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;If they have dentures, including partial dentures, whether they are marked or unmarked. If unmarked, ask whether they would like to arrange for marking and offer to help. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The name and address of their dentist or any dental service they have had contact with, and where and how long ago they saw a dentist or received dental treatment. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Record if there has been no contact or they do not have a dentist, and help them find one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make an appointment for the resident to see a dental practitioner, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Record the results of the assessment and the appointment in the resident's personal care plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Review and update residents' mouth care needs in their personal care plans as their mouth care needs change (see the &quot;Daily Mouth Care&quot; section).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Daily Mouth Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These recommendations are for managers of care staff who support daily personal care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ensure care staff provide residents with daily support to meet their mouth care needs and preferences, as set out in their personal care plan after their assessment. This should be aligned with the advice in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention&quot; title=&quot;UK Government Web site&quot;&gt;Delivering better oral health&lt;/a&gt; toolkit, including:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Brushing natural teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Providing daily oral care for full or partial dentures (such as brushing, removing food debris and removing dentures overnight) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Using their choice of cleaning products for dentures if possible &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Using their choice of toothbrush, either manual or electric/battery powered &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Daily use of mouth care products prescribed by dental clinicians (for example, this may include a high fluoride toothpaste or a prescribed mouth rinse [see NICE's guideline &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/sc1&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;Managing medicines in care homes&lt;/a&gt;]) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Daily use of any over-the-counter products preferred by residents if possible, such as particular mouth rinses or toothpastes; if the resident uses sugar-free gum, consider gum containing xylitol &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ensure care staff know which member of staff they can ask for advice about getting prescribed mouth care products, or helping someone to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ensure care staff know how to recognise and respond to changes in a resident's mouth care needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ensure care staff know how to respond if a resident does not want daily mouth care or to have their dentures removed (see NICE's Web site page on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/about/nice-communities/public-involvement/your-care&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;your care&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Care Staff Knowledge and Skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These recommendations are for care home managers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ensure care staff who provide daily personal care to residents:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Understand the importance of residents' oral health and the potential effect on their general health, wellbeing and dignity. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Understand the potential impact of untreated dental pain or mouth infection on the behaviour, and general health and wellbeing of people who cannot articulate their pain or distress or ask for help. (This includes, for example, residents with dementia or communication difficulties.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Know how and when to reassess residents' oral health (see &quot;Oral Health Assessment and Mouth Care Plans,&quot; above). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Know how to deliver daily mouth care (see &quot;Daily Mouth Care&quot;). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Know how and when to report any oral health concerns for residents, and how to respond to a resident's changing needs and circumstances. (For example, some residents may lose their manual dexterity over time.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Understand the importance of denture marking and how to arrange this for residents, with their permission. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Availability of Local Oral Health Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This recommendation is for health and wellbeing boards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ensure local oral health services address the identified needs of people in care homes, including their need for treatment. Identify gaps in provision. (See recommendation 1 in NICE's guideline &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph55&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;Oral health: approaches for local authorities and their partners to improve the oral health of their communities&lt;/a&gt;.)

Also explain the role of diet, alcohol and tobacco in promoting good oral health, in line with advice in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/delivering-better-oral-health-an-evidence-based-toolkit-for-prevention&quot; title=&quot;UK Government Web site&quot;&gt;Delivering better oral health&lt;/a&gt; toolkit and NICE's guideline &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-phg60&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;Oral health promotion: general dental practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Help care home managers find out about local oral health services and create local partnerships or links with general dental practice and community dental services including special care dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tell local authority public health teams and dental public health leads about gaps in the services, so they can advocate for accessible oral and dental health services on behalf of residents of care homes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;General Dental Practices and Community Dental Services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These recommendations are for dental practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Provide residents in care homes with routine or specialist preventive care and treatment as necessary, in line with local arrangements (see NICE's guidelines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg19&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;Dental checks: intervals between oral health reviews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph55&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;Oral health: approaches for local authorities and their partners to improve the oral health of their communities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph55&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;Oral health promotion: general dental practice)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ensure dentures made for individual residents are appropriately marked by the lab during manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength of Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The committee makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the GC is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words are used (for example, 'do not offer&amp;hellip;') when the GC is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interventions That Could Be Used&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Where synthesis of results was feasible via meta-analysis, the effect size and 95% confidence interval are reported within the evidence statement. Where this was not feasible, the number of studies reporting statistically significant and non-significant results was reported.

Analysis was conducted in stages (method), and themes were generated from data. Qualitative NVivo software was used to highlight and retrieve coded text in order to assist analysis.

Members noted the lack of research about the oral health needs of younger adults in care homes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee noted that oral health research tends to use clinical dental indices (such as the plaque, gingival and denture plaque indices) as outcome measures. It observed that by looking only at clinical outcomes, the research does not reflect other outcomes that are more important to people, such as wellbeing. The committee also noted that there is no accepted mechanism for converting the resulting 'scores' into outcomes that matter to patients, residents or carers, such as improved self-esteem, dignity, or quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee considered that the choice of measures in the past may have hindered high quality research to develop innovative person-centred outcome measures. It discussed the urgent need for measures and study designs to capture the perspective of the full range of residents living in care homes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would include how much importance residents, or those who care for them, place on having a clean, pain-free, healthy mouth. It would also include how poor oral health may affect the care they receive, and how their dignity and individuality are respected and understood (especially with regard to wearing and removal of dentures).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to &quot;The Committee's Discussion&quot; section of the original guideline document for discussions that explain how the committee made its recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The committee makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the Guideline Committee (GC) is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions That Must (or Must Not) Be Used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee usually uses 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally 'must' (or 'must not') is used if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions That Should (or Should Not) Be Used &amp;ndash; a 'Strong' Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee uses 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. Similar forms of words are used (for example, 'do not offer&amp;hellip;') when the GC is confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions That Could Be Used&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee uses 'consider' when confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time considering and discussing the options with the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

In the absence of such evidence, NICE would usually develop a bespoke model to estimate cost-effectiveness, ideally using the preferred method of cost&amp;ndash;utility analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE explored this approach after identifying evidence that poor oral health may be associated with cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease (utility values are available for these health states, so a cost&amp;ndash;utility analysis would be possible). However, on further examination and after discussion with the committee, it was decided that the evidence was insufficient to show that poor oral health directly causes these diseases. So a cost&amp;ndash;utility model was not developed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on the evidence available, it was apparent the economic analysis would be limited to measures of oral health. Moreover, given the lack of evidence on health-state utility values related to oral health, the committee supported development of a cost&amp;ndash;consequences analysis, rather than a cost&amp;ndash;utility analysis. It favoured this approach because it can capture a wide range of benefits. However, the outcomes of the source studies were limited to clinical measures and so the economic model analysis could not, as had been hoped, report on a wide range of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee agreed that the effectiveness review had identified the best available evidence to inform the analysis and 2 interventions were included:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Direct education of care staff and oral health care &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Direct education of care staff, and use of a protocol for planning and delivering oral care and compliance checking &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These interventions mirrored the types of approaches the committee was considering making recommendations about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The perspective of the cost&amp;ndash;consequences analysis was a single care home. The time horizon was 2 years, based on the average length of stay for a resident reported in the literature. The inputs included:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Number of residents &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Percentage of residents who need help with daily oral care &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Whether residents use manual or electric toothbrushes &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Roles of staff carrying out the interventions &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Whether the time of staff who attend oral education training is 'back filled' &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Number of education sessions to ensure all relevant staff are trained &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to &quot;Economic Evidence&quot; in the original guideline document for additional information, including results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Stakeholders can register at any point during guideline development. NICE informs registered stakeholders and respondents that the draft is available and invites them to comment by the deadline. Questions for stakeholders are posted with the draft guideline. The purpose of these questions is to seek stakeholder views on factors such as the potential equality impact.

How long may vary from guideline to guideline, and depends on how much change in practice or services is needed. Implementing change is most effective when aligned with local priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Changes should be implemented as soon as possible, unless there is a good reason for not doing so (for example, if it would be better value for money if a package of recommendations were all implemented at once).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different organisations may need different approaches to implementation, depending on their size and function. Sometimes individual practitioners may be able to respond to recommendations to improve their practice more quickly than large organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some pointers to help organisations put NICE guidelines into practice:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raise awareness&lt;/strong&gt; through routine communication channels, such as email or newsletters, regular meetings, internal staff briefings and other communications with all relevant partner organisations. Identify things staff can include in their own practice straight away. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify a lead&lt;/strong&gt; with an interest in the topic (it could be someone who is already championing oral health in your local area) to motivate and support others to use the guideline and make service changes, and to find out about any significant issues locally. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carry out a baseline assessment&lt;/strong&gt; against the recommendations to find out whether there are gaps in current service provision. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about what data you need to measure improvement&lt;/strong&gt; and plan how you will collect it. You may want to work with other health and social care organisations and specialist groups to compare current practice with the recommendations. This may also help identify local issues that will slow or prevent implementation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop an action plan&lt;/strong&gt;, with the steps needed to put the guideline into practice, and make sure it is ready as soon as possible. Big, complex changes may take longer to implement, but some may be quick and easy to do. An action plan will help in both cases. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For very big changes&lt;/strong&gt; include milestones and a business case, which will set out additional costs, savings and possible areas for disinvestment. A small project group could develop the action plan. The group might include the guideline champion, a senior organisational sponsor, staff involved in the associated services, finance and information professionals. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement the action plan&lt;/strong&gt; with oversight from the lead and the project group. Big projects may also need project management support. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review and monitor how&lt;/strong&gt; well the guideline is being implemented through the project group. Share progress with those involved in making improvements, as well as relevant boards and local partners. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE provides a comprehensive programme of support and resources to maximise uptake and use of evidence and guidance.
