      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination/Centre for Health Economics (CRD/CHE), University of York (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's submission described the search strategies used to identify relevant clinical effectiveness studies about the use of teriflunomide for the treatment of relapsing&amp;ndash;remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The electronic databases MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Embase.com) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched to identify clinical studies on the use of teriflunomide and other comparators. In addition to this, grey literature was searched in several medical society and regulatory body Web sites and a hand search was carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Searches were conducted in May 2012 and subsequently updated on 12 November 2012. The searches covered the period 1st January 1980&amp;ndash;November 12 2012, were limited to English language publications, and excluded letters, editorials, comments and animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall the searches were appropriate and well documented, and included the use of both subject indexing terms (MeSH and EMTREE) and free text searching. Field searching, Boolean operators and truncation were used where required. All the databases required by NICE were searched, though only CENTRAL was searched in the Cochrane Library when it might have been useful to have searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database. For this reason the manufacturer missed a protocol of a Cochrane Systematic Review on teriflunomide for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that is finished and published now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trade name of teriflunomide and the trade name of its comparators were not included in the search strategies. It is possible (though not likely) that potentially useful records were not retrieved. The search strategies used in the manufacturer's submission were limited to experimental trials. However a search for other study designs such as cohort or case control studies may have provided useful supplementary information about safety. It is not clear if the methodological search filters used in PubMed and EMBASE were derived from validated search filters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusion Criteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer outlined appropriate inclusion criteria for population, interventions and comparators, outcomes and study designs. It is noted that eligibility criteria for the review included patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). All included direct trials of teriflunomide had a small percentage of patients with SPMS (at least 87% were patients with RRMS). The Committee considered this to be overall acceptable but it is noted, in contrast, that the trials in the mixed treatment comparison (MTC) largely had 100% RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer included open-label extension studies in addition to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in order to assess long-term safety of teriflunomide. This approach is acceptable. However the efficacy data from these trials should be treated with some caution as there is no concurrent placebo group and therefore no information on natural course of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The restriction to English language trials only could have led to trials being missed but in this instance the ERG is unaware of any missing trials. The manufacturer's flow diagram does not include data (no. of studies, etc.) included and excluded from the direct evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's submission described the search strategies used to identify cost-effectiveness studies relevant to this appraisal of teriflunomide for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The electronic databases MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process (via EMBASE) and EMBASE (via EMBASE), EconLit (Ovid), the Cochrane Library (Wiley) including the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) were searched. In addition to this, a grey literature search was performed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Database searches were performed on 10th and 11th October 2012. Search strategies for each database were documented. The searches covered the period 1966&amp;ndash;October 2012 for MEDLINE and EMBASE, 1961&amp;ndash;October 2012 for Econlit and 1968&amp;ndash;October 2012 for NHS EED. No language or date limits were applied to the search. The search excluded animal studies as well as the publication types 'letter' and 'editorial', and 'note'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The searches were appropriate and comprehensive, and included the use of both subject indexing terms and free text searching. Field searching, Boolean operators and truncation were used where required. All NICE required databases were searched, as well as medical society and regulatory body websites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A methodological search filter adapted from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network Grading (SIGN) was included to identify economic studies and utilities in MEDLINE and EMBASE. The adapted economic study design search filter may have excluded potentially useful records from MEDLINE and EMBASE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The addition of the following EMTREE terms would have improved the filter used in EMBASE and MEDLINE: 'Economic evaluation' and 'Cost utility'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important issue is that the manufacturer didn't adapt the search for MEDLINE, instead they searched EMBASE and MEDLINE together from the EMBASE interface. They used the same search and the same methodological filter developed for EMBASE. The Cochrane Manual advises to adapt the searches to every database.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The systematic review of the literature resulted in no cost-effectiveness analyses of teriflunomide. Two cost-effectiveness analyses of other treatments were identified to help inform the development of the &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination/Centre for Health Economics, University of York (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Details of data extraction methods were not provided (such as number of reviewers involved and procedures to avoid errors and bias). The ERG could not, therefore, comment on the robustness of the data extraction methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's quality assessment was adapted from the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) guidance covering: randomisation, allocation concealment, similarity of groups at outset, blinding, differential dropout, under-reporting of outcomes and use of intention to treat analysis. This tool was appropriate. Trials of both direct evidence and those included in the base case mixed treatment comparison (MTC) were assessed. No quality data were provided for the trials included in the sensitivity analysis of the mixed treatment comparison (trials conducted post 2000 and &amp;ge;80% relapsing&amp;ndash;remitting multiple sclerosis [RRMS]).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer undertook a meta-analysis of all the three placebo-controlled trials (Study 2001, TEMSO and TOWER) using a random-effects model. A random effects model may not have been appropriate due to the small number of studies (2 or 3 in each analysis). The manufacturer checked for statistical heterogeneity and clinical diversity and did not find major issues of heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study of teriflunomide vs. Rebif 44&amp;mu;g (TENERE) was not included in the meta-analysis as there was no placebo arm. This was appropriate. Results of the trial were tabulated and synthesised narratively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To supplement the direct evidence the manufacturer conducted a MTC indirectly comparing eleven licensed and unlicensed drugs including beta-interferon and glatiramer acetate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Safety data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and trial extensions were presented individually. A pooled analysis was conducted using adverse event data from Study 2001 and TEMSO only.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 4 of the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for more information and a critique of methods conducted by the ERG.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The systematic review of the literature resulted in no cost-effectiveness analyses of teriflunomide.

See Sections 5 and 6 in the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for extensive discussions of the manufacturer's economic evaluation, the ERG's critique of the model, and addition ERG analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The Committee noted that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) estimated by the manufacturer's revised model were substantially higher than those in NICE technology appraisal guidance 32 for most of the comparators. The Committee noted the considerable uncertainty in the current analyses, and the analyses carried out for &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA32&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;NICE technology appraisal guidance 32&lt;/a&gt;, and acknowledged that showing close convergence between the previous and present analyses was challenging. The Committee concluded that the manufacturer's model was sufficiently valid for decision-making in the current appraisal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporation of Health-related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-Related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee concluded that the quality-of-life benefits of an oral treatment were not fully captured in the QALY.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost-Effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee was aware that the key drivers of the economic model were the choice of comparator, disease progression, the natural history, the rate of transition to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, and health-related quality of life associated with more severe health states.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee concluded that teriflunomide dominated the beta interferons. For the comparison with glatiramer acetate, the Committee noted the varying ICERs from the different analyses but accounting for the benefits not captured in the QALY, such as the oral administration of teriflunomide, the Committee concluded that, on balance, the most plausible ICER for teriflunomide compared with glatiramer acetate would be below &amp;pound;20,000 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 4 in the original guideline document for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;This guidance represents the views of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and was arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" />

This means that, if a patient has active relapsing&amp;ndash;remitting multiple sclerosis and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that teriflunomide is the right treatment, it should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The Department of Health and the manufacturer have agreed that teriflunomide will be available to the NHS with a patient access scheme, which makes teriflunomide available with a discount. The size of the discount is commercial in confidence. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to communicate details of the discount to the relevant NHS organisations. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;NICE has developed tools to help organisations put this guidance into practice. These are available on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA303&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;NICE Web site&lt;/a&gt; (see also the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
