persistent rhinitis; chronic middle ear disease with or without hearing loss; a history in term infants of neonatal upper and lower respiratory symptoms or neonatal intensive care admittance (&lt;strong&gt;strong recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients with normal situs presenting with other symptoms suggestive of PCD (as listed in recommendation 1 above) should be referred for diagnostic testing (&lt;strong&gt;strong recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Siblings of patients should be tested for PCD, particularly if they have symptoms suggestive of PCD (as listed in recommendation 1) (&lt;strong&gt;strong recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The Task Force recommends the use of combinations of distinct PCD symptoms and predictive tools (e.g., PICADAR) to identify patients for diagnostic testing (&lt;strong&gt;weak recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nasal Nitric Oxide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In patients suspected of having PCD should nasal nitric oxide be used as a diagnostic tool?&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on moderate confidence in the evidence, the Task Force recommends that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot;

Criteria 2-6 are assessed as either serious or very serious.

For reaching recommendations, the Task Force took into account the quality of the evidence; the balance between benefits and harms; the patients' values and preferences and other factors such as costs, feasibility, accessibility etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

In a first step, at least two researchers from each Work Group (WG) screened the titles and abstracts, to exclude manuscripts that clearly did not address the PICO or the WG's additional questions. In a second step, two searchers (one for genetics due to lack of researchers) reviewed the full texts of the remaining papers, to identify manuscripts that addressed the PICO and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Third, the committee and WG members received the lists of identified papers and were asked to report any additional studies not identified by the search. All data fulfilling the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; inclusion criteria were included.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Task Force included all peer reviewed manuscripts from 1996 to 14th March 2016 with no language limitations. It was decided that manuscripts predating 1996 would be unlikely to reliably diagnose primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) versus non-PCD according to current standards. The Task Force excluded conference proceedings, grey literature and studies in non-humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

These were circulated for editing to the Task Force (TF) panel. Each WG decided what data was required a) to answer the PICO (Patient, Intervention/investigation, Comparison, Outcome), and b) to answer additional questions. Data were extracted by two independent researchers with the exception of genetics WG which used single extraction due to lack of researchers. Since there is no reference standard for diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), details of how diagnosis was confirmed/excluded was extracted for all studies and acceptability agreed by the TF panel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Quality of Evidence Leading to Recommendations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) is a method for systematically assessing the quality of evidence for a diagnostic test and then making recommendations for use of the test based on the quality of this evidence. Using the GRADE approach the TF rated the overall quality of evidence for each question as high, moderate, low or very low, based on the following criteria: study design, risk of bias, directness, consistency, precision and publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The identified manuscripts were assessed on the following criteria &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study design&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; for example a randomised controlled trial (although very few exist in diagnostics) would be a higher level of evidence than prospective cohort studies and these would be higher than case-control studies. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of bias&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The TF assessed risk of bias using the Quadas-2 tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies, based on four domains (a) patient selection; b) conduct or interpretation of index test; c) selection, conduct or interpretation of reference standard; and d) patient flow. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directness&lt;/strong&gt; - This refers to the existence of a direct link between the diagnostic test and patient important outcomes. For intervention studies, intermediate outcomes, such as accuracy of diagnostic tests, are always considered &quot;indirect&quot; evidence and thus reduce the quality. Therefore, directness was graded as &quot;potentially serious&quot; in all WGs. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency&lt;/strong&gt; - This refers to the degree to which reported study results (e.g., sensitivity, specificity) from included studies are similar; thus heterogeneity of results was reported as inconsistency. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Precision refers to the degree of certainty concerning the estimates of each test performance (quantified by the width of confidence intervals around estimates). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication bias&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; This indicates that studies may have been published selectively and pooled estimates of published studies might not reflect the truth (e.g., negative findings have not been published, or are unavailable). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Criteria 2-6 are assessed as either serious or very serious.

A leadership group of four were responsible for chairing meetings, providing support to the work groups and monitoring progress. This leadership group also coordinated the writing of the practice guideline and oversaw the editing. Work Group (WG) leaders were proposed and agreed at the first meeting of the task force, based on their expertise. Following training from European Respiratory Society (ERS) methodologists in Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), systematic reviewers drafted protocols for the searches, conducted systematic reviews, extracted data from the chosen manuscripts, assessed the quality of the data and finally synthesised the data using narrative and if appropriate meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The TF panel comprised experts and trainees in the field of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) from multidisciplinary backgrounds including pulmonologists; ear, nose, and throat (ENT); cell scientists; electron microscopists and geneticists. Their expertise included clinical phenotyping, screening tests including nasal nitric oxide (nNO), ex-vivo and in-vivo ciliary function tests including high-speed video microscopy analysis (HSVA) and radioaerosol mucociliary clearance, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cell culture (submerged and at air-liquid interface [ALI]), lung physiology and imaging, epidemiology and qualitative research. Some members of the panel lead national diagnostic centres, and there were members from countries where diagnostic facilities are limited. Members of the panel volunteered to participate in WG activities based on their expertise and interests. The ERS provided support to the panel from two methodologists, an advisor for dissemination and a junior committee member; the methodologists did not participate in the votes of the recommendations, the dissemination advisor and junior committee member were paediatric pulmonologists and did contribute to WG activities, panel discussions and voting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A larger group with interest in PCD has met annually at ERS Congresses since 2006. The opinions of this group of over 60 clinicians, nurses, scientists and allied health professionals were sought and taken into account when deciding which tests to evaluate and which questions needed answering by the TF.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two patient representatives participated in the first task force meeting, helped in the project design, contributed to the writing of the practice guideline and the dissemination of the report. The European Lung Foundation contributed to the first meeting. An international survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted to understand the patient perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Formulation of the Topics and Questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The panel met with a wider group of professionals (n=80) interested in PCD during ERS Congress 2014. A semi-structured discussion led to understanding of current diagnostic pathways and tests across Europe, and the questions that clinicians and scientists need answering. These discussions informed a closed meeting of the TF panel. The panel agreed that six diagnostic tests (clinical symptoms, nasal nitric oxide [nNO], high speed video-microscopy [HSV], transmission electron microscopy [TEM], genotype and immunofluorescence labelling of ciliary proteins [IF]) would be evaluated using a 'PICO' (Patient, Intervention/Investigation, Comparison, Outcome) structured question: &quot;Patients suspected of having PCD, Investigated by nNO, TEM etc., when Comparing patients with a final positive or negative diagnostic outcome, what was the diagnostic accuracy (Outcome) of the test?&quot; The TF primarily aimed to identify studies of consecutive patients referred for PCD testing, in whom the PCD diagnosis was either confirmed or excluded. In the absence of sufficient literature of this study design, it was agreed that the comparator group might include healthy controls, or patients with other respiratory diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis [CF], asthma) from case control studies, but this would down grade the level of evidence. Lack of a gold standard diagnostic test for PCD was a limitation for this project. Diagnostic performance indicators (e.g., sensitivity and specificity) were therefore compared to the authors' final decision regarding positive/negative diagnosis based on available tests. The PICO questions for each test were finalised during several rounds of teleconferences and email discussions (see Table S2 in supplementary materials).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several less structured questions were agreed to provide the basis of a narrative synthesis, but these questions were not used to provide recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Quality of Evidence Leading to Recommendations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final grading of the evidence helped to inform the final recommendations as either STRONG (should always be done) or WEAK (should be performed in certain circumstances). For reaching recommendations, the Committee took into account the quality of the evidence; the balance between benefits and harms; the patients' values and preferences and other factors such as costs, feasibility, accessibility etc. Evidence profiles were discussed with and across WGs electronically and by telephone conferences throughout the duration of the TF and discussed in a face-to-face meeting of the entire TF panel at the 2015 ERS Congress in Amsterdam. Sections of the manuscript were written by WG leaders and members of their groups, and again discussed and amended electronically across WGs and within the committee. Evidence that was of a lower quality than that used for recommendations was commented on in the guideline but was not used to make recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Consensus Statement for Diagnostic Outcomes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The TF conducted a modified Delphi survey in four rounds to develop consensus regarding the contributions of diagnostic tests to confirm or refute a diagnosis of PCD. Only members of the Task Force with relevant expertise participated by completing online questionnaires (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isurvey.soton.ac.uk/&quot; title=&quot;iSurvey Web site&quot;&gt;https://www.isurvey.soton.ac.uk/&lt;/a&gt;). Respondents were anonymous to others with the exception of the Chair who could identify participants. Before each round participants reviewed the results of previous surveys, including a summation of comments with reasons underlying opinions and recommendations for iterations. The first round of the survey aimed to understand if any individual tests could definitively confirm or exclude a diagnosis of PCD. In the second round each Delphi participant was asked to review the summary of responses from round 1; they were then invited to consider combinations of tests that might confirm or exclude a diagnosis when the diagnosis is considered clinically very likely, or only modest. In round 3 and 4 there were further iterations. A consensus was reached when 80% of participants were in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

It is the individual responsibility of health professionals to consult other sources of relevant information, to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient&amp;rsquo;s health condition and in consultation with that patient and the patient's caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary, and to verify rules and regulations applicable to drugs and devices at the time of prescription. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The patient representatives to the Task Force fully endorsed that an accurate diagnosis was an important outcome, because it leads to a better recognition of their problems by physicians and more effective treatment, and thus improves their health and quality of life.
