Patients with the following pathologic features may be reasonably treated with or without vaginal brachytherapy: (1) grade 3 cancers without myometrial invasion (&lt;strong&gt;grade: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;) or (2) grade 1 or 2 cancers with &amp;lt;50% myometrial invasion and higher-risk features, such as age &amp;gt;60 and/or lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (&lt;strong&gt;grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;). See Table 1 in the original guideline document for consensus/percent agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KQ2 Guideline Statement: Which Patients with Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer Should Receive Vaginal Cuff Radiation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vaginal cuff brachytherapy is as effective as pelvic radiation therapy at preventing vaginal recurrence for patients with: (1) grade 1 or 2 cancers with &amp;ge;50% myometrial invasion or (2) grade 3 tumors with &amp;lt;50% myometrial invasion (&lt;strong&gt;grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;). Vaginal cuff brachytherapy is preferred to pelvic radiation in patients with these risk factors, particularly in those patients who have had comprehensive nodal assessment (&lt;strong&gt;grade: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;). See Table 1 in the original guideline document for consensus/percent agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KQ3 Guideline Statement (A): Which Women with Early-Stage Endometrial Cancer Should Receive Postoperative External Beam Radiation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pelvic radiation is an effective means of decreasing pelvic recurrence for early-stage patients but has not been proven to improve overall survival. Patients with grade 3 cancer with &amp;ge;50% myometrial invasion or cervical stromal invasion may benefit from pelvic radiation to reduce the risk of pelvic recurrence (&lt;strong&gt;grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;). Patients with grade 1 or 2 tumors with &amp;ge;50% myometrial invasion may also benefit from pelvic radiation to reduce pelvic recurrence rates if other risk factors are present, such as age &amp;gt;60 years and/or LVSI (&lt;strong&gt;grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KQ3 Guideline Statement (B): Which Women with Stage III-IVA Endometrial Cancer Should Receive Postoperative External Beam Radiation? The Use of Pelvic Radiation Has Been Shown to Improve Survival in Some Settings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best available evidence at this time suggests that a reasonable option for adjuvant treatment of patients with positive nodes or involved uterine serosa, ovaries/fallopian tubes, vagina, bladder, or rectum includes external beam radiation therapy as well as adjuvant chemotherapy (&lt;strong&gt;grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;). Chemotherapy (&lt;strong&gt;grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;) or radiation therapy alone (&lt;strong&gt;grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;) may be considered for some patients based on pathologic risk factors for pelvic recurrence. See Table 1 in the original guideline document for consensus/percent agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KQ4 Guideline Statement: When Should Brachytherapy Be Used in Addition to External Beam Radiation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prospective data is lacking to validate the use of vaginal brachytherapy after pelvic radiation and retrospective studies show little conclusive evidence of a benefit, albeit with small patient numbers. Use of vaginal brachytherapy in patients also undergoing pelvic external beam radiation may not generally be warranted, unless risk factors for vaginal recurrence are present (&lt;strong&gt;grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;). See Table 1 in the original guideline document for consensus/percent agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KQ5 Guideline Statement: How Should Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy be Integrated in the Management of Endometrial Cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best available evidence suggests that concurrent chemoradiation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated for patients with positive nodes or involved uterine serosa, ovaries/fallopian tubes, vagina, bladder, or rectum (&lt;strong&gt;grade: strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;). Alternative sequencing strategies with external beam radiation and chemotherapy are also acceptable (&lt;strong&gt;grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;). Chemotherapy (&lt;strong&gt;moderate-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;) or radiation therapy alone (&lt;strong&gt;low-quality evidence&lt;/strong&gt;) may be considered for some patients based on pathologic risk factors for pelvic recurrence.

This also means that further research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate-Quality Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence is considered moderate quality when it is obtained from RCTs with important limitations&amp;mdash;for example, biased assessment of the treatment effect, large loss to follow-up, lack of blinding, or unexplained heterogeneity (even if it is generated from rigorous RCTs). It also includes indirect evidence originating from similar (but not identical) populations of interest and RCTs with a very small number of participants or observed events. In addition, evidence from well-designed controlled trials without randomization, well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, and multiple time series with or without intervention are in this category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that further research will probably have an important effect on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-Quality Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence obtained from observational studies would typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research is very likely to have an important effect on our confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably change the estimate. However, the quality of the evidence from observational studies may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on circumstances under which evidence is obtained. Factors that may contribute to upgrading the quality of evidence include a large magnitude of the observed effect, a dose-response association, or the presence of an observed effect when all plausible confounders would decrease the observed effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACP Process for Assigning Strength of Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that the benefit of the intervention outweighs the risk, and the panel has reached uniform consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that the benefit of the intervention equals the risk, or vice versa, and the panel has reached uniform or nonuniform consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analytic framework, based on the identified population, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICO) was used to refine the search. The population was defined as women of all races, aged 18 years or older, with stage I-IV endometrial cancer of any histologic grade. A search was conducted for studies that included patients treated with no adjuvant therapy, or pelvic and/or vaginal brachytherapy with or without systemic chemotherapy. To assess the interventions employed by the studies, a literature search based on the following outcomes was conducted: survival rates, local and distant recurrence rates, toxicity, and overall assessment of quality of life. Exclusion criteria included trials of preoperative radiation therapy (RT), patients with distant metastasis, and patients with unresected gross residual disease after hysterectomy. Literature searches were performed on electronic databases that included &quot;English only&quot; literature from 1980 to 2011: MEDLINE PubMed, EMBASE, and the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Review Group (CGCRG). Additionally, reference lists of previous systematic reviews and other relevant papers were searched. Randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized clinical trials, observational studies, abstracts, and conference proceedings were searched as well. The initial search yielded 1077 abstracts. Articles were reviewed for inclusion by American Society for&amp;nbsp;Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) staff and co-chairs of the guideline. Next, 148 articles were excluded due to small sample size, distant metastatic disease, medically inoperable patients, management of recurrences, and not being clinically relevant to the key questions. A second assessment resulted in the exclusion of 599 articles due to duplicate studies, sarcoma, studies involving less than 10 patients and studies not being clinically relevant to the key clinical questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guidelines Subcommittee of the Clinical Affairs and Quality Council, in accordance with established American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) policy, recruited a guideline panel of recognized experts in endometrial cancer including radiation oncologists (including one resident member), gynecologic oncologists, and radiation physicists in academic settings and private practice. The panel provided guidance on the use of radiation therapy for patients with endometrial cancer. In February 2011, the ASTRO Board of Directors approved the &lt;em&gt;Postoperative Radiation Therapy for Endometrial Cancer Guideline&lt;/em&gt; proposal and panel membership. Next, the panel participated in a series of communications by electronic mail and conference telephone calls to draft the guideline. Members of the panel were divided into subgroups, according to their areas of expertise, to address the key questions (KQs). All members of the panel evaluated the responses to the questions assigned to the subgroups, according to their areas of expertise, to address the KQs. All members of the panel evaluated the responses to the questions assigned to the subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When available, high-quality evidence formed the basis of the recommendation statements in accordance with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards. Guideline statements were developed and included evidence ratings. The level of consensus on the guideline recommendation statements among the panelists was evaluated through a modified Delphi approach. The survey including guideline recommendation statements was sent by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) staff to the panel members. Panelists rated the agreement with each recommendation pertaining to the key clinical questions on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree, as depicted in Table 1 in the original guideline document (higher score corresponds with stronger agreement); a prespecified threshold of &amp;ge;75% of raters was determined to indicate when consensus was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Vaginal brachytherapy doesn't address the paravaginal tissues and draining lymphatics. The side effects of vaginal cuff irradiation are generally limited to vaginal complications and mild urinary side effects. Nine percent of patients in a randomized trial receiving brachytherapy developed grade 1 and 2 vaginal toxicity as compared to 1.5% of patients in the observation arm. Grade 1 and 2 urinary side effects were slightly more common after vaginal irradiation (2.8% vs 0.6%, respectively, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .063) but brachytherapy did not impact the rates of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Brachytherapy dose has been shown to impact vaginal toxicity. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Grade 2 or higher diarrhea affects 50% to 80% of patients receiving pelvic radiation during and in the immediate posttreatment period. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Some studies have reported higher rates of toxicity among patients receiving both brachytherapy and external beam. The addition of brachytherapy to pelvic radiation also increased the risk of second primary cancers in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) study. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
