For example, evidence is judged as high quality if all of the following apply: there is a wide range of studies included in the analyses with no major limitations, there is little variation between studies, and the summary estimate has a narrow confidence interval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence is judged as &lt;strong&gt;moderate quality&lt;/strong&gt; when the Task Force considers that the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. For example, evidence might be judged as moderate quality if any of the following applies: there are only a few studies and some have limitations but not major flaws, there is some variation between studies, or the confidence interval of the summary estimate is wide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence is judged to be &lt;strong&gt;low or very low quality&lt;/strong&gt; when the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. For example, evidence might be judged as low quality if any of the following applies: the studies have major flaws, there is important variation between studies, or the confidence interval of the summary estimate is very wide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grading of Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong recommendations&lt;/strong&gt; are those for which the task force is confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects (strong recommendation for an intervention) or that the undesirable effects of an intervention outweigh its desirable effects (strong recommendation against an intervention). A strong recommendation implies that most people will be best served by the recommended course of action. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak recommendations&lt;/strong&gt; are those for which the desirable effects probably outweigh the undesirable effects (weak recommendation for an intervention) or undesirable effects probably outweigh the desirable effects (weak recommendation against an intervention) but appreciable uncertainty exists. A weak recommendation implies that most people would want the recommended course of action, but many would not. For clinicians, this means they must recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual women, and they must help each woman arrive at a management decision consistent with her own values and preferences. Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Weak recommendations result when the balance between desirable and undesirable effects is small, the quality of evidence is lower, and there is more variability in the values and preferences of patients. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The search was quite broad in nature with the only limitations being date, human subjects and English or French language. In addition, a grey literature search using a number of keyword terms for depression and screening was undertaken focusing on Canadian sources. This included both site specific searching (see Appendix A of the systematic review document) and a general Google search limited to &quot;pages from Canada&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the contextual questions on depression screening, it was not necessary to undertake a separate search as any results would be a subset of the results of the search for Key Question (KQ) 1 and KQ2. Articles addressing these questions were identified as part of the screening process for the key questions. For contextual questions, three separate searches were conducted in the databases mentioned above: 1) systematic reviews on depression treatment, 2) systematic reviews on adverse events associated with treatment, and 3) patient preferences and values regarding treatment for depression. All these searches were limited to the last 5 years, human subjects and English or French language. Detailed search strategies can be found in Appendix A of the systematic review document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: A systematic evidence review was prepared by the Evidence Review and Synthesis Centre at McMaster University for the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Assessment, Data Abstraction and Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each title and abstract was reviewed by two trained screeners and disagreements were resolved by a third screener, any article marked for inclusion by either team member went on to full text rating. Full text inclusion and quality assessment were each done by two people and data abstraction was done by one person and checked by another. All disagreements were resolved through discussion. The inclusion results were reviewed by a third person. The exception to this process were studies related to the contextual questions of costs, performance indicators, patient preferences, and subpopulations, for which abstraction was done by one person and evidence was not rated using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Five quasi-experimental studies with pre- and post-implementation design were quality appraised with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) measuring the domains: selection of study groups, comparability of study groups, and means of ascertaining exposure or outcome. The NOS uses a 'star system' to score studies (maximum score is nine stars).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The strength of evidence was determined based on the GRADE system of rating quality of evidence using GRADEPro software. This system of grading evidence has been widely used and has been endorsed by over 40 major organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The GRADE system rates the quality of a body of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low; each of the four levels reflects a different assessment of the likelihood that further research will impact the estimate of effect (e.g., high quality: further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect). A GRADE quality rating is based on an assessment of five conditions: (1) limitations in study designs (risk of bias), (2) inconsistency (heterogeneity) in the direction and/or size of the estimates of effect, (3) indirectness of the body of evidence to the populations, interventions, comparators and/or outcomes of interest, (4) imprecision of results (few events/observations, wide confidence intervals), and (5) indications of reporting or publication bias. Grouped RCTs begin with a high quality rating which may be downgraded if there are serious or very serious concerns across the studies related to one or more of the five conditions. All groups of observational (e.g., case-control and cohort) studies begin with a low quality rating which may be further downgraded based on assessments of the same five criteria. All other types of evidence are assigned a very low quality rating. For this review, key data were entered into the GRADEPro software along with the quality assessment ratings to produce two analytic products, the GRADE Evidence Profile Tables and the GRADE Summary of Findings Tables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Review Manager 5.1 was used for meta-analysis. Pooled relative risk (RR) was used to summarize the effect of intervention on suicide (dichotomous outcome). A Random Effect assumption (Inverse Variance Weighting method) was used to calculate pooled estimates and the corresponding confidence intervals. Homogeneity between studies was assessed using the &amp;chi;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; test and the I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistic. Heterogeneity was considered significant if the p-value was less than 0.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

A strong recommendation implies that most people will be best served by the recommended course of action. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak recommendations&lt;/strong&gt; are those for which the desirable effects probably outweigh the undesirable effects (weak recommendation for an intervention) or undesirable effects probably outweigh the desirable effects (weak recommendation against an intervention) but appreciable uncertainty exists. A weak recommendation implies that most people would want the recommended course of action, but many would not. For clinicians, this means they must recognize that different choices will be appropriate for each individual, and they must help each person arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her own values and preferences. Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Weak recommendations result when the balance between desirable and undesirable effects is small, the quality of evidence is lower, or there is more variability in the values and preferences of patients. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Evidence from a modelling study in the United States suggested that one-time screening for depression may be cost-effective. However, this conclusion was based on a low-cost screening approach (maximum $6 per person) and on high remission rates associated with treatment (settings that can achieve full remission in 45% of patients and partial remission in an additional 25%). Given the lack of support for these assumptions, the validity of this conclusion is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The time clinicians take to screen for depression reduces their availability to deliver other services of known clinical benefit (opportunity cost). Evidence from a Canadian modelling study suggests that routine screening to identify new cases of depression, resulting in increased rates of treatment, may not reduce the burden of depression. Instead, focusing efforts on reducing episodes of relapse (e.g., through long-term treatment in patients with known depression) may be a more efficient use of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The studies that were reviewed in the original guideline document evaluated the effectiveness of the community-based depression screening programs which incorporated screening for depression, follow-up with mental health care or psychiatric treatment, and health education in the community setting in rural Japan with higher than average rates of suicide. As such, the observed reduction in suicide rates or recovery from depression cannot be attributed solely to the screening component of these programs. The findings of this review are affected by the limitations of the included literature. The search was limited to papers written in English or French. There is the potential that the guideline developers may&amp;nbsp;have missed the opportunity to analyze data from papers written in other languages. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The decision to recommend against screening was based on the lack of evidence on the benefits and harms of routinely screening asymptomatic adults. Despite the lack of evidence, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) had concerns about the potential harms of screening (e.g., false positives). In the absence of a demonstrated benefit of screening, and considering the potential harms, the CTFPHC recommends not routinely screening asymptomatic adults from average and increased risk groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The views of the funding bodies have not influenced the content of the guideline; competing interests have been recorded and addressed.

Yet, clinicians can use symptoms of depression (e.g., insomnia, low mood, anhedonia&amp;nbsp;and suicidal thoughts) to identify patients with potential depression. Evidence suggests that detecting depression based on clinical symptoms tends to identify patients with more severe depression, who may be more likely to benefit from treatment. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of depression in patients with clinical clues, especially those at increased risk of depression, and implement treatment as appropriate when depression is diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patient Preferences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although there was high variability in patient preferences and values, patients generally consider screening for depression to be important and the screening tools to be acceptable. However, most studies of the acceptability of screening for depression that were identified in the systematic review focused on perinatal women. There was some evidence that any treatment in identified cases should be culturally sensitive and that matching treatment to patient preferences improves outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Staff-Assisted Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Integrated staff-assisted systems engage case managers, care support and coordination staff, or social workers, who play a central role in working with primary care physicians, mental health specialists and nurse practitioners to provide depression management and follow-up. Evidence suggests that such integrated systems may be more effective than usual care in increasing the likelihood of successful treatment of depression. However, it is unclear whether screening is a necessary component of these programs. Nevertheless, clinicians practising in a setting where there are integrated staff-assisted systems may be more inclined to choose screening given that treatment is more likely to be effective in this setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
