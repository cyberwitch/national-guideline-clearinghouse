It has been adapted and integrated from the 2013 WHO publication &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic criteria and classification of hyperglycaemia first detected in pregnancy&lt;/em&gt;, which states that GDM should be diagnosed at any time in pregnancy if one or more of the following criteria are met: &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&quot;Note&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Fasting plasma glucose 5.1&amp;ndash;6.9 mmol/L (92&amp;ndash;125 mg/dL) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;1-hour plasma glucose &amp;ge;10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) following a 75 g oral glucose load &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;2-hour plasma glucose 8.5&amp;ndash;11.0 mmol/L (153&amp;ndash;199 mg/dL) following a 75 g oral glucose load &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy should be diagnosed if one or more of the following criteria are met:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&quot;Note&quot; style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Fasting plasma glucose &amp;ge;7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;2-hour plasma glucose &amp;ge;11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) following a 75 g oral glucose load &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Random plasma glucose &amp;ge;11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) in the presence of diabetes symptoms &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tobacco Use&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health-care providers should ask all pregnant women about their tobacco use (past and present) and exposure to second-hand smoke as early as possible in pregnancy and at every antenatal care visit (&lt;strong&gt;Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Substance Use&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health-care providers should ask all pregnant women about their use of alcohol and other substances (past and present) as early as possible in the pregnancy and at every antenatal care visit (&lt;strong&gt;Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Syphilis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In high-prevalence settings,&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) for HIV should be considered a routine component of the package of care for pregnant women in all antenatal care settings. In low-prevalence settings, PITC can be considered for pregnant women in antenatal care settings as a key component of the effort to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and to integrate HIV testing with syphilis, viral or other key tests, as relevant to the setting, and to strengthen the underlying maternal and child health systems (&lt;strong&gt;Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;High-prevalence settings are defined in the 2015 WHO publication &lt;em&gt;Consolidated guidelines on HIV testing services&lt;/em&gt; as settings with greater than 5% HIV prevalence in the population being tested. Low-prevalence settings are settings with less than 5% HIV prevalence in the population being tested.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuberculosis (TB)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In settings where the tuberculosis (TB) prevalence in the general population is 100/100 000 population or higher, systematic screening for active TB should be considered for pregnant women as part of antenatal care (&lt;strong&gt;Context-specific recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fetal Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Fetal Movement Counting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Daily fetal movement counting, such as with &quot;count-to-ten&quot; kick charts, is only recommended in the context of rigorous research (&lt;strong&gt;Context-specific recommendation &amp;ndash; research&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Symphysis-fundal Height (SFH) Measurement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Replacing abdominal palpation with symphysis-fundal height (SFH) measurement for the assessment of fetal growth is not recommended to improve perinatal outcomes. A change from what is usually practiced (abdominal palpation or SFH measurement) in a particular setting is not recommended (&lt;strong&gt;Context-specific recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antenatal Cardiotocography (CTG&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Routine antenatal cardiotocography is not recommended for pregnant women to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes (&lt;strong&gt;Not recommended&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultrasound Scan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One ultrasound scan before 24 weeks of gestation (early ultrasound) is recommended for pregnant women to estimate gestational age, improve detection of fetal anomalies and multiple pregnancies, reduce induction of labour for post-term pregnancy, and improve a woman's pregnancy experience (&lt;strong&gt;Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doppler Ultrasound of Fetal Blood Vessels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Routine Doppler ultrasound examination is not recommended for pregnant women to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes (&lt;strong&gt;Not recommended&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Preventive Measures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antibiotics for Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ASB)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A seven-day antibiotic regimen is recommended for all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) to prevent persistent bacteriuria, preterm birth and low birth weight (&lt;strong&gt;Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antibiotic Prophylaxis to Prevent Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections (RUTI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic prophylaxis is only recommended to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections in pregnant women in the context of rigorous research (&lt;strong&gt;Context-specific recommendation &amp;ndash; research&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antenatal Anti-D Immunoglobulin Prophylaxis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Antenatal prophylaxis with anti-D immunoglobulin in non-sensitized Rh-negative pregnant women at 28 and 34 weeks of gestation to prevent RhD alloimmunization is recommended only in the context of rigorous research (&lt;strong&gt;Context-specific recommendation &amp;ndash; research&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive Anthelminthic Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In endemic areas,&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; preventive anthelminthic treatment is recommended for pregnant women after the first trimester as part of worm infection reduction programmes (&lt;strong&gt;Context-specific recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;Greater than 20% prevalence of infection with any soil-transmitted helminths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tetanus Toxoid Vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tetanus toxoid vaccination is recommended for all pregnant women, depending on previous tetanus vaccination exposure, to prevent neonatal mortality from tetanus (&lt;strong&gt;Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermittent Preventive Treatment of Malaria in Pregnancy (IPTp)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In malaria-endemic areas in Africa, intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) is recommended for all pregnant women. Dosing should start in the second trimester, and doses should be given at least one month apart, with the objective of ensuring that at least three doses are received&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Context-specific recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;Integrated from the WHO publication &lt;em&gt;Guidelines for the treatment of malaria&lt;/em&gt; (2015), which also states: &quot;WHO recommends that, in areas of moderate-to-high malaria transmission of Africa, IPTp-SP be given to all pregnant women at each scheduled ANC visit, starting as early as possible in the second trimester, provided that the doses of SP are given at least 1 month apart. WHO recommends a package of interventions for preventing malaria during pregnancy, which includes promotion and use of insecticide-treated nets, as well as IPTp-SP.&quot; To ensure that pregnant women in endemic areas start IPTp-SP as early as possible in the second trimester, policy-makers should ensure health system contact with women at 13 weeks of gestation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) should be offered as an additional prevention choice for pregnant women at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of combination prevention approaches&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Context-specific recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;Integrated from the WHO publication &lt;em&gt;Guideline on when to start antiretroviral therapy and on pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV&lt;/em&gt; (2015). Substantial risk of HIV infection is defined by an incidence of HIV infection in the absence of PrEP that is sufficiently high (&amp;gt;3% incidence) to make offering PrEP potentially cost-saving (or cost-effective).

Evidence on effectiveness was mostly derived from Cochrane reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Steering Group, in collaboration with the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group (PCG) and methodologists from Centro Rosarino de Estudios Perinatales (CREP), initially identified all Cochrane systematic reviews and protocols relevant to antenatal care (ANC). The Cochrane PCG Trials Register was searched for new trials and the relevant systematic reviews were updated accordingly. The updating or completion of Cochrane reviews was a collaborative process between authors of the individual reviews, staff of the PCG, and methodologists from CREP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) Steering Group and the methodologists in the TWG determined the suitability of each Cochrane systematic review to provide the evidence base for the key population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) questions. For suitable reviews, CREP methodologists retrieved the evidence relevant to ANC guideline outcomes, which was evaluated according to standard operating procedures approved by the Steering Group. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a low-quality review or no systematic review was identified on a priority question, a new systematic review was commissioned from external experts. This was the case with all diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) reviews, the qualitative reviews on women's and health-care providers' views on ANC, and the review on factors affecting ANC intervention implementation at country level. In these instances, the external researchers were asked to prepare standard protocols before embarking on the systematic reviews, including clear PICO questions, criteria for identification of studies (including search strategies for different bibliographic databases), methods for assessing risk of bias and the plan for data analysis. The protocols were reviewed and endorsed by the Steering Group and selected content experts among the guideline development group (GDG) members. WHO information retrieval specialists reviewed the search strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Cochrane review evidence, for three questions related to health systems (i.e., those on women-held case notes, group ANC, and interventions to communicate with and support pregnant women), indirect evidence was sought, due to a paucity of direct evidence. This work was commissioned from experts at the Norwegian Public Health Institute who conducted a systematic search for indirect evidence on effects of these interventions covering the preceding five years (i.e., from January 2011 to January 2016), but found no additional evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The DTA reviews on haemoglobin and urine tests were commissioned from methodologists from Queen Mary University of London, in the United Kingdom. For these reviews, EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE (OVID), SCOPUS and Web of Science were searched from inception to January 2015, and grey literature was sought by searching GreyOpen. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two qualitative reviews were commissioned from experts from the University of Central Lancashire, United Kingdom: &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;To explore the views, attitudes and experiences of pregnant and postnatal women in high-, medium-, and low-income countries in relation to factors that might form barriers to, or facilitators of, their use of routine ANC services. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;To explore the views, attitudes and experiences of health-care providers in high-, medium- and low-income countries in relation to factors that might form barriers to, or facilitators of, their provision of good quality routine ANC services. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies published before 2000 were excluded, to ensure that the data reflected the current generation of women who may encounter ANC, and the current generation of ANC providers. This date range was also intended to capture the time period since the 2002 introduction of the WHO focused ANC (FANC) or &quot;basic&quot; ANC model, which includes four goal-orientated ANC visits. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, two researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Norwegian Public Health Institute undertook a review of case studies reporting the experiences of countries. The review focused on methods of uptake and implementation of the WHO FANC model, problems experienced by service users and other stakeholders, and the broader context. Data were collected from published studies, reports and other policy documents (see the Web supplement [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field] for the search strategy), and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders for each country case study, which included Argentina, Kenya, Thailand and the United Republic of Tanzania. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The entire systematic review development process was iterative, with the methodologists in constant communication with the Steering Group to discuss challenges and agree on solutions. The search strategies for evidence identification and retrieval can be found in Web supplement (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Document&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;ANC-related Recommendations in Other WHO Guidelines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To avoid duplication and ensure harmonization of recommendations across WHO departments and publications, all relevant WHO Guidelines Review Committee (GRC)-approved guidelines were searched and 21 guidelines containing recommendations relevant to ANC were identified (see Annex 2 in the original guideline document). These recommendations were mapped to the priority questions for this new guideline and the Steering Group reached out to the WHO departments and technical units that had issued the relevant guidance to engage and collaborate with them throughout the process of developing this new ANC guideline. Recommendations found in other WHO guidelines that related to health promotion and the identification of risk factors (e.g., smoking, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) during ANC were considered to be within the scope of the guideline, whereas recommendations on management and treatment of risk factors, complications and concurrent diseases were deemed to be beyond the scope of the guideline; for these, the guideline user is referred to the relevant separate WHO guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessment of the quality of individual studies included in Cochrane reviews of intervention studies follows specific and explicit methods for assessing the risk of bias using six standard criteria outlined in the &lt;em&gt;Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions&lt;/em&gt;. Each included study is assessed and rated by reviewers to be at low, high or unclear risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of study personnel and participants, attrition, selective reporting and other sources of bias, such as publication bias. The assessment of these six criteria provides an overall risk of bias that indicates the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and how it is likely to impact the review findings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Quality Assessment and Grading of the Evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to appraising the quality of quantitative evidence was used for all the critical outcomes identified in the population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICOs), and a GRADE profile was prepared for each quantitative outcome within each PICO. Accordingly, the quality of evidence for each outcome was rated as &quot;high,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; &quot;low,&quot; or &quot;very low&quot; based on a set of criteria. As a baseline, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provided &quot;high-quality&quot; evidence, while non-randomized trials and observational studies provided &quot;low-quality&quot; evidence. This baseline quality rating was then downgraded based on consideration of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias. For observational studies, other considerations, such as magnitude of effect, could lead to upgrading of the rating if there were no limitations that indicated a need for downgrading. Grading of Cochrane review evidence and diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) evidence was performed by Centro Rosarino de Estudios Perinatales (CREP) and the methodologists from Queen Mary University of London, respectively, in accordance with standard operating procedures approved by the Steering Group. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies identified for the qualitative reviews were subjected to a simple quality appraisal system using a validated instrument that rated studies against 11 criteria, and then allocated a score from A to D, with D indicating the presence of significant flaws that are very likely to affect the credibility, transferability, dependability and/or confirmability of the study. Studies scoring D were excluded on grounds of poor quality. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the qualitative reviews were appraised for quality using the GRADE-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) tool. The GRADE-CERQual tool, which uses a similar approach conceptually to other GRADE tools, provides a transparent method for assessing and assigning the level of confidence that can be placed in evidence from reviews of qualitative research. The qualitative review team used the GRADE-CERQual tool to assess the confidence in qualitative review findings, which were assigned to evidence domains on values, acceptability and feasibility according to four components: methodological limitations of the individual studies, adequacy of data, coherence and relevance to the review question of the individual studies contributing to a review finding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the systematic reviews (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

In summary, the process included: identification of priority questions and outcomes, retrieval of evidence, assessment and synthesis of the evidence, formulation of recommendations, and planning for the implementation, dissemination, impact evaluation and updating of the guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;WHO Steering Group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The WHO Steering Group that guided the entire guideline development process comprised WHO staff members from the Department of Reproductive Health and Research (RHR), the Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (MCA), and the Department of Nutrition for Health and Development (NHD) (see Annex 1 in the original guideline document for the list of members). Regional advisors from WHO regions also participated in the guideline development process. The Steering Group drafted the initial scope of the guideline and drafted the key recommendation questions in PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, outcome), identified individuals to be invited to participate as guideline methodologists and as members of the systematic review teams, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) and the External Review Group (ERG), supervised the evidence retrieval and synthesis, organized the Technical Consultations (or GDG meetings), drafted recommendations, and finalized and published the guideline document. Additionally, the Steering Group will oversee dissemination of the guideline. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Guideline Development Group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Steering Group identified and invited 20 external experts and stakeholders from the six WHO regions to form the GDG, ensuring geographic representation, gender balance, and no important conflicts of interest. The GDG was a diverse group of individuals with expertise in research, guideline development methods, and clinical policy and programmes relating to interventions for antenatal care (ANC) and service delivery, also including a patient/consumer representative. The curriculum vitae of the members were published on the RHR departmental Web site prior to the GDG meetings (which occurred between October 2015 and March 2016). Subgroups were invited to each of the meetings based on their expertise. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Selected members of the GDG provided input into the drafting of the scope of the guideline, the PICO questions and the prioritization of outcomes, which guided the evidence reviews. The GDG as a whole appraised the evidence used to inform the guideline, advised on the interpretation of this evidence, formulated the final recommendations at face-to-face meetings, and reviewed and approved the final guideline document before its submission to the WHO Guidelines Review Committee (GRC) for approval. A list of the members of the GDG can be found in Annex 1 of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Technical Working Group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Technical Working Group (TWG) comprised systematic review teams and guideline methodologists. In relation to quantitative evidence on the effectiveness of different interventions, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group (PCG) provided input on the scoping of the guideline and supervised the updating of all relevant systematic reviews following the standard processes of the Cochrane Collaboration. The WHO Steering Group worked closely with methodologists from the Centro Rosarino de Estudios Perinatales (CREP), in Argentina, to appraise the evidence from systematic reviews using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For qualitative data related to women's and healthcare professionals' views on ANC, two qualitative meta-synthesis experts from the University of Central Lancashire, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), systematically reviewed qualitative studies and synthesized the evidence to inform the GDG's decision-making, in collaboration with the Steering Group and methodologists from the Norwegian Public Health Institute. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, methodologists from Queen Mary University of London, in the United Kingdom, conducted test accuracy reviews of diagnostic tests relevant to the provision of ANC to support this guideline. The Steering Group also worked closely with experts from the Norwegian Public Health Institute, who assisted with methodological issues relating to the GRADE, GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research), and DECIDE (Developing and Evaluating Communication Strategies to Support Informed Decisions and Practice Based on Evidence)&amp;nbsp;tools. In addition, the Steering Group consulted two researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Norwegian Public Health Institute, who reviewed country case studies to investigate implementation issues relating to the WHO focused ANC (FANC) model. Members of the TWG are listed in Annex 1 of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;External Partners and Observers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) were invited to the final GDG meeting to serve as observers. All these organizations are potential implementers of the proposed guideline with a history of collaboration with the WHO Departments of RHR and MCA in guideline dissemination and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Formulation of the Recommendations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Steering Group supervised and finalized the preparation of evidence summaries and evidence profiles in collaboration with the guideline methodologists, using the Developing &amp;amp; Evaluating Communication strategies to support Informed Decisions &amp;amp; Practice based on Evidence (DECIDE) framework. DECIDE is an evidence-to-decision (EtD) tool that includes explicit and systematic consideration of evidence on interventions in terms of six domains: effects, values, resources, equity, acceptability and feasibility. For each priority question, judgements are made on the impact of the intervention on each of these domains, in order to inform and guide the decision-making process. Using the DECIDE framework, the Steering Group created summary documents for each priority question covering evidence on each of the six domains. See the original guideline document for a description of the domains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These evidence summaries and draft recommendations, including GRADE tables and other related documents, were provided to members of the GDG for comments in advance of the series of three Technical Consultations on the ANC guideline. The certainty of the graded evidence on effectiveness was systematically interpreted in the text according to guidance on reporting review evidence from the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) Group. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG members and other participants were subsequently invited to attend three Technical Consultations (also called GDG meetings) organized at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, the first two in October 2015 and the third in March 2016 (see Annex 1 in the original guideline document for a full list of participants) to review the evidence and formulate recommendations for the ANC guideline. At these meetings, under the leadership of the GDG chair, GDG members reviewed the evidence summaries, the draft recommendations and any comments received through preliminary feedback. The purpose of the meetings was to reach consensus on each judgement and each recommendation, including its direction and context (if any), and to discuss implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and research priorities related to the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Decision-making During the GDG Meetings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG meetings were guided by a clear protocol. Each of the three meetings was designed to allow participants to discuss each of the recommendations drafted by the Steering Group. Where necessary, each of these recommendations was revised through a process of group discussion. The final adoption of each recommendation was confirmed by consensus (i.e., full agreement among all GDG members). The GDG also determined the context of recommendations at the meetings by the same process of consensus, based on discussions around the balance of evidence on benefits and disadvantages of the interventions across the domains evaluated. If GDG members had been unable to reach a consensus, the disputed recommendation, or any other decision, would have been put to a vote, by a show of hands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Document Preparation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following these three GDG meetings, members of the Steering Group prepared a draft of the full guideline document with revisions to accurately reflect the deliberations and decisions of the GDG participants. This draft guideline was then sent electronically to the GDG participants for further comments before it was sent to the External Review Group (ERG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;It has been established that by implementing timely and appropriate evidence-based practices, antenatal care (ANC) can save lives. Crucially, ANC also provides the opportunity to communicate with and support women, families and communities at a critical time in the course of a woman's life. The process of developing these recommendations on ANC has highlighted the importance of providing effective communication about physiological, biomedical, behavioural and sociocultural issues, and effective support, including social, cultural, emotional and psychological support, to pregnant women in a respectful way. These communication and support functions of ANC are key, not only to saving lives, but to improving lives, health-care utilization and quality of care. Women's positive experiences during ANC and childbirth can create the foundations for healthy motherhood. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The Guideline Development Group (GDG) noted that the effects of introducing antenatal ultrasound on population health outcomes and health systems in rural, low-resource settings are unproven. However, the introduction of ultrasound to detect pregnancy complications and confirm fetal viability to the woman and her family in these settings could plausibly increase ANC service utilization and reduce morbidity and mortality, when accompanied by appropriate gestational age estimation, diagnosis, referral and management. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The practice of woman-held case notes may improve the availability of women's medical records and might also be an effective tool to improve health awareness and client&amp;ndash;provider communication. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Effective interventions in disadvantaged populations could help to address health inequalities. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) improves individual health outcomes, prevents mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and prevents horizontal transmission of HIV from the mother to an uninfected sexual partner. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the &quot;Additional considerations,&quot; &quot;Maternal outcomes,&quot; and &quot;Fetal and neonatal outcomes&quot; sections in the original guideline document for additional information on benefits of specific interventions.&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Early detection of fetal compromise could lead to timely clinical interventions to reduce poor perinatal outcomes but might lead to maternal anxiety or unnecessary clinical interventions. It is also possible that the period between decreased fetal movements and fetal death might be too short to allow effective action to be taken. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;There is some evidence that women do not understand that ultrasound is a diagnostic tool, and that adverse findings during scans might increase anxiety and distress. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Moderate-certainty evidence shows that intermittent iron supplementation is probably less commonly associated with nausea than daily iron supplementation (7 trials, 1034 women; RR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.37&amp;ndash;0.97). However, the evidence on other specific side-effects (constipation, diarrhoea, heartburn or vomiting) or any side-effect is of very low certainty. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Side-effects and safety of pharmacological agents were poorly reported in the included studies. However, drowsiness is a common side-effect of various antihistamines used to treat nausea and vomiting. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Metoclopramide is generally not recommended in the first trimester of pregnancy, but is widely used. A study of over 81,700 singleton births in Israel reported that they found no statistically significant differences in the risk of major congenital malformations, low birth weight, preterm birth or perinatal death between neonates exposed (3458 neonates) and not exposed to metoclopramide in the first trimester of gestation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Women should be informed that it is unclear whether there are side-effects to alternative treatment options for low back and pelvic pain (physiotherapy, support belts and acupuncture) due to a paucity of data. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Side-effects of fibre supplements include abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A high level of accuracy in detecting asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is important to avoid treating women unnecessarily, particularly in view of increasing antimicrobial resistance. Based on uncertain evidence, and assuming a prevalence of ASB of 9%, there would be 18 and 118 false-positive tests per 1000 women tested with Gram stain and dipstick tests, respectively. This suggests that, in settings where pregnant women are treated for ASB, dipstick diagnosis of ASB might lead to many women receiving unnecessary treatment. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Apart from false reassurance, which might occur with both symphysis-fundal height (SFH) measurement and clinical palpation, there is no evidence of harm with SFH measurement. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the &quot;Additional considerations,&quot; &quot;Maternal outcomes,&quot; and &quot;Fetal and neonatal outcomes&quot; sections in the original guideline document for additional information on harms of specific interventions.&lt;/p&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Declaration of Interests (DOI) by External Contributors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) handbook for guideline development, all Guideline Development Group (GDG) members, External Review Group (ERG) members and other external collaborators were asked to declare in writing any competing interests (whether academic, financial or other) at the time of the invitation to participate in the antenatal care (ANC) guideline development process. The standard WHO form for DOI was completed and signed by each expert and sent electronically to the responsible technical officer. The WHO Steering Group reviewed all the DOI forms before finalizing experts' invitations to participate. All experts were instructed to notify the responsible technical officer of any change in relevant interests during the course of the process, in order to update and review conflicts of interest accordingly. In addition, experts were requested to submit an electronic copy of their curriculum vitae along with the completed DOI form. The responsible technical officer collated and reviewed signed DOI forms and curriculum vitae, in conjunction with the director of the WHO Department of Reproductive Health and Research (RHR) and, with input from the Steering Group, determined whether a conflict of interest existed. Where any conflict of interest was declared, the Steering Group determined whether it was serious enough to affect the individual's ability to make objective judgements about the evidence or recommendations. To ensure consistency, the Steering Group applied the criteria for assessing the severity of a conflict of interest in the &lt;em&gt;WHO handbook for guideline development&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All findings from the received DOI statements were managed in accordance with the WHO DOI guidelines on a case-by-case basis. Where a conflict of interest was not considered significant enough to pose any risk to the guideline development process or reduce its credibility, the expert was only required to declare such conflict at the GDG meeting and no further action was taken. Conflicts of interest that warranted action by WHO staff arose where experts had performed primary research or a systematic review related to any guideline recommendations; in such cases, the experts were restricted from participating in discussions and/or formulating any recommendation related to the area of their conflict of interest. At the final GDG meeting, members were required again to state any conflicts of interest openly to the entire group, and were required to submit a signed and updated version of their earlier DOI statements. A summary of the DOI statements and information on how conflicts of interest were managed are included in Annex 3 of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
