The full version of the original guideline document gives details of the methods and the evidence used to develop the guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All recommendations relate to children and young people aged under 18 years unless otherwise specified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;General Principles of Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Safely and Effectively with Children and Young People&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health and social care professionals working with children and young people who present with behaviour suggestive of a conduct disorder, or who have a conduct disorder, should be trained and competent to work with children and young people of all levels of learning ability, cognitive capacity, emotional maturity and development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health and social care professionals should ensure that they:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Can assess capacity and competence, including &quot;Gillick competence&quot;, in children and young people of all ages &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Understand how to apply legislation, including the Children Act (1989), the Mental Health Act (1983; amended 1995 and 2007) and the Mental Capacity Act (2005), in the care and treatment of children and young people. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health and social care providers should ensure that children and young people:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Can routinely receive care and treatment from a single team or professional &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Are not passed from one team to another unnecessarily &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Do not undergo multiple assessments unnecessarily&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When providing assessment or treatment interventions for children and young people, ensure that the nature and content of the intervention is suitable for the child or young person's developmental level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider children and young people for assessment according to local safeguarding procedures if there are concerns regarding exploitation or self-care, or if they have been in contact with the criminal justice system&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing Relationships With Children and Young People and Their Parents or Carers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be aware that many children and young people with a conduct disorder may have had poor or punitive experiences of care and be mistrustful or dismissive of offers of help as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Develop a positive, caring and trusting relationship with the child or young person and their parents or carers to encourage their engagement with services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health and social care professionals working with children and young people should be trained and skilled in:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Negotiating and working with parents and carers &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Managing issues relating to information sharing and confidentiality as these apply to children and young people &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a young person is &quot;Gillick competent&quot; ask them what information can be shared before discussing their condition with their parents or carers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When working with children and young people with a conduct disorder and their parents or carers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Make sure that discussions take place in settings in which confidentiality, privacy and dignity are respected &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Be clear with the child or young person and their parents or carers about limits of confidentiality (that is, which health and social care professionals have access to information about their diagnosis and its treatment and in what circumstances this may be shared with others)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When coordinating care and discussing treatment decisions with children and young people and their parents or carers, ensure that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Everyone involved understands the purpose of any meetings and why information might need to be shared between services &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The right to confidentiality is respected throughout the process &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working With Parents and Carers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If parents or carers are involved in the treatment of young people with a conduct disorder, discuss with young people of an appropriate developmental level, emotional maturity and cognitive capacity how they want them to be involved. Such discussions should take place at intervals to take account of any changes in circumstances, including developmental level, and should not happen only once&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be aware that parents and carers of children and young people with a conduct disorder might feel blamed for their child's problems or stigmatised by their contact with services. When offering or providing interventions such as parent training programmes, directly address any concerns they have and set out the reasons for and purpose of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Offer parents and carers an assessment of their own needs including:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Personal, social and emotional support &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Support in their caring role, including emergency plans &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Advice on practical matters such as childcare, housing and finances, and help to obtain support &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication and Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When communicating with children and young people with a conduct disorder and their parents or carers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Take into account the child or young person's developmental level, emotional maturity and cognitive capacity, including any learning disabilities, sight or hearing problems, or delays in language development or social communication difficulties &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Use plain language if possible and clearly explain any clinical language; adjust strategies to the person's language ability, for example, breaking up information, checking back, summarising and recapping &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Check that the child or young person and their parents or carers understand what is being said &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Use communication aids (such as pictures, symbols, large print, braille, different languages or sign language) if needed &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When giving information to children and young people with a conduct disorder and their parents or carers, ensure you are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Familiar with local and national sources (organisations and websites) of information and/or support for children and young people with a conduct disorder and their parents or carers &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Able to discuss and advise how to access these resources &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Able to discuss and actively support children and young people and their parents or carers to engage with these resources&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When communicating with a child or young person use diverse media, including letters, phone calls, emails or text messages, according to their preference&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Culture, Ethnicity and Social Inclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When working with children and young people with a conduct disorder and their parents or carers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Take into account that stigma and discrimination are often associated with using mental health services &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Be respectful of and sensitive to children and young people's gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, background (including cultural, ethnic and religious background) and any disability &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Be aware of possible variations in the presentation of mental health problems in children and young people of different genders, ages, cultural, ethnic, religious or other diverse backgrounds&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When working with children and young people and their parents or carers who have difficulties speaking or reading English:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Provide and work proficiently with interpreters if needed &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Offer a list of local education providers who can provide English language teaching &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health and social care professionals working with children and young people with a conduct disorder and their parents or carers should have competence in:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Assessment skills and using explanatory models of conduct disorder for people from different cultural, ethnic, religious or other diverse backgrounds &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Explaining the possible causes of different mental health problems, and care, treatment and support options &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Addressing cultural, ethnic, religious or other differences in treatment expectations and adherence &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Addressing cultural, ethnic, religious or other beliefs about biological, social and familial influences on the possible causes of mental health problems &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Conflict management and conflict resolution&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staff Supervision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health and social care services should ensure that staff supervision is built into the routine working of the service, is properly resourced within local systems and is monitored. Supervision should:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Make use of direct observation (for example, recordings of sessions) and routine outcome measures &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Support adherence to the specific intervention &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Focus on outcomes &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Be regular and apply to the whole caseload &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer and Discharge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anticipate that withdrawal and ending of treatments or services, and transition from one service to another, may evoke strong emotions and reactions in children and young people with a conduct disorder and their parents or carers. Ensure that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Such changes, especially discharge and transfer from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to adult services, are discussed and planned carefully beforehand with the child or young person and their parents or carers, and are structured and phased &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Children and young people and their parents or carers are given comprehensive information about the way adult services work and the nature of any potential interventions provided &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Any care plan supports effective collaboration with social care and other care providers during endings and transitions, and includes details of how to access services in times of crisis &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;When referring a child or young person for an assessment in other services (including for psychological interventions), they are supported during the referral period and arrangements for support are agreed beforehand with them&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For young people who continue to exhibit antisocial behaviour or meet criteria for a conduct disorder while in transition to adult services (in particular those who are still vulnerable, such as those who have been looked after or who have limited access to care) (see the NICE guideline &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG77&quot; title=&quot;NICE Web site&quot;&gt;Antisocial personality disorder.

Pathways should:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Offer prompt assessments and interventions that are appropriately adapted to the cultural, gender, age and communication needs of children and young people with a conduct disorder and their parents and carers &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Keep to a minimum the number of assessments needed to access interventions&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health and social care professionals, managers and commissioners should work with colleagues in educational settings to design local care pathways that respond promptly and effectively to the changing needs of all populations served by the pathways. Pathways should have in place:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Clear and agreed goals for the services offered to children and young people with a conduct disorder and their parents and carers &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Robust and effective means for measuring and evaluating the outcomes associated with the agreed goals &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Clear and agreed mechanisms for responding promptly to changes in individual needs&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health and social care professionals, managers and commissioners should work with colleagues in educational settings to design local care pathways that provide an integrated programme of care across all care settings.

There should be protocols for:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Sharing information with children and young people with a conduct disorder, and their parents and carers, about their care &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Sharing and communicating information about the care of children and young people with other professionals (including general practitioners) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Communicating information between the services provided within the pathway &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Communicating information to services outside the pathway&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Health and social care professionals, managers and commissioners should work with colleagues in educational settings to design local care pathways that have robust systems for outcome measurement in place, which should be used to inform all involved in a pathway about its effectiveness. This should include providing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Individual routine outcome measurement systems &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Effective electronic systems for the routine reporting and aggregation of outcome measures &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Effective systems for the audit and review of the overall clinical and cost effectiveness of the pathway&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Adapted from Service user experience in adult mental health (NICE clinical guidance 136).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Adapted from Common mental health disorders (NICE clinical guideline 123).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The manual should have been positively evaluated in a randomised controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; At the time of publication (March 2013) some preparations of risperidone did not have a UK marketing authorisation for this indication in young people and no preparations were authorised for use in children aged under 5 years.

The balance between sensitivity (the power to identify all studies on a particular topic) and specificity (the ability to exclude irrelevant studies from the results) was carefully considered, and a decision made to utilise a broad approach to searching to maximise retrieval of evidence to all parts of the guideline. Searches were restricted to systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, and conducted in the following databases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Australian Education Index &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Applied Social Services Index and Abstracts &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;British Education Index &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Campbell Collaboration &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Central (centralised database of RCTs and other controlled studies) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effectiveness &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Embase &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Education Resources in Curriculum &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Health Management Information Consortium &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;HTA database (technology assessments) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;International Bibliography of Social Sciences &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE/in-process database for MEDLINE [PreMEDLINE]) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;National Criminal Justice Reference Service &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;PsycBOOKS, the full-text database of books and chapters in the American Psychological Association's electronic databases &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;PsycEXTRA, a grey literature database, which is a companion to PsycINFO &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Social Science Abstracts &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Social Science Citation Index &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Sociological Abstracts &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Web-based searches for additional evidence were performed in Social Care Online &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategies were initially developed for MEDLINE before being translated for use in other databases/interfaces. Strategies were built up through a number of trial searches, and discussion of the results of the searches with the review team and GDG, to ensure that all possible relevant search terms were covered. In order to assure comprehensive coverage, search terms for the main population were kept purposely broad to help counter dissimilarities in database indexing practices, and imprecise reporting of study populations by authors in the titles and abstracts of records. For standard mainstream bibliographic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE and PsycINFO), search terms for main population were combined with the intervention(s), together with a research-based filter for the study design of interest. For smaller, topic-specific databases (for example education and sociological databases), a search, modified to be more precise, was conducted for the main population and study design of interest only. The search terms for each search are set out in full in Appendix 7 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EndNote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Citations from each search were downloaded into the reference management software and duplicates removed. Records were then screened against the eligibility criteria of the reviews before being quality appraised (see the &quot;Study Selection and Quality Assessment&quot; section, below). The unfiltered search results were saved and retained for future potential re-analysis, to help keep the process both replicable and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Filters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To aid retrieval of relevant and sound studies, filters were used to limit a number of searches to systematic reviews, RCTs and observational studies. The search filters for systematic reviews and RCTs are adaptations of filters designed by the Centre for Reviews Dissemination, York, the Health Information Research Unit of McMaster University, Ontario, and the University of Alberta. The observational study filter is an in-house development. Each filter comprises index terms relating to the study type(s) and associated textwords for the methodological description of the design(s).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date and Language Restrictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systematic database searches were initially conducted in June 2011 up to the most recent searchable date. Search updates were generated on a 6-monthly basis, with the final re-runs carried out in July 2012 ahead of the guideline consultation. After this point, studies were only included if they were judged by the GDG to be exceptional (for example if the evidence was likely to change a recommendation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although no language restrictions were applied at the searching stage, foreign language papers were not requested or reviewed, unless they were of particular importance to a review question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Date restrictions were not applied, except for searches of systematic reviews which were limited to research published from 1995. This restriction was put in place because older reviews were thought to be less useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Search Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other search methods involved: (a) scanning the reference lists of all eligible publications (systematic reviews, stakeholder evidence and included studies) for more published reports and citations of unpublished research; (b) sending lists of studies meeting the inclusion criteria to subject experts (identified through searches and the GDG) and asking them to check the lists for completeness, and to provide information of any published or unpublished research for consideration (Appendix 4 in the full version of the original guideline document); (c) checking the tables of contents of key journals for studies that might have been missed by the database and reference list searches; (d) tracking key papers in the Science Citation Index (prospectively) over time for further useful references; (e) conducting searches in ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished trial reports; (f) contacting included study authors for unpublished or incomplete data sets. Searches conducted for existing NICE guidelines were updated where necessary. Other relevant guidelines were assessed for quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument (AGREE) instrument (AGREE Collaboration, 2003). The evidence base underlying high-quality existing guidelines was utilised and updated as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Full details of the search strategies and filters used for the systematic review of clinical evidence are provided in Appendix 7 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Selection and Quality Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All primary-level studies included after the first scan of citations were acquired in full and re-evaluated for eligibility at the time they were being entered into the study information database. More specific eligibility criteria were developed for each review question and are described in the relevant clinical evidence chapters. Eligible systematic reviews and primary-level studies were critically appraised for methodological quality (see Appendix 9 in the full version of the original guideline document for further information). The eligibility of each study was confirmed by at least one member of the appropriate topic group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some review questions, it was necessary to prioritise the evidence with respect to the UK context (that is, external validity). To make this process explicit, the topic groups took into account the following factors when assessing the evidence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Participant factors (for example gender, age and ethnicity) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Provider factors (for example model fidelity, the conditions under which the intervention was performed and the availability of experienced staff to undertake the procedure) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cultural factors (for example differences in standard care and differences in the welfare system) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was the responsibility of each topic group to decide which prioritisation factors were relevant to each review question in light of the UK context and then decide how they should modify their recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpublished Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG used a number of criteria when deciding whether or not to accept unpublished data. First, the evidence must have been accompanied by a trial report containing sufficient detail to properly assess the quality of the data. Second, the evidence must have been submitted with the understanding that data from the study and a summary of the study's characteristics would be published in the full guideline. Therefore, the GDG did not accept evidence submitted as commercial in confidence. However, the GDG recognised that unpublished evidence submitted by investigators might later be retracted by those investigators if the inclusion of such data would jeopardise publication of their research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Search Strategy for Economic Evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scoping Searches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A broad preliminary search of the literature was undertaken in November 2010 to obtain an overview of the issues likely to be covered by the scope, and help define key areas.

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) commissioned the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH) in partnership with the Social Care Institute for Excellence to develop this guideline (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Data Extraction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Study characteristics and outcome data were extracted from all eligible studies that met the minimum quality criteria, using Review Manager 5.1 and an Excel-based form (see Appendix 8 in the full version of the original guideline document).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In most circumstances, for a given outcome (continuous and dichotomous), where more than 50% of the number randomised to any group were missing or incomplete, the study results were excluded from the analysis (except for the outcome &quot;leaving the study early&quot;, in which case the denominator was the number randomised). Where there was limited data for a particular review the 50% rule was not applied. In these circumstances the evidence was downgraded due to the risk of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where possible, we used outcome data from an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (that is, a &quot;once-randomised-always-analyse&quot; basis). For dichotomous efficacy outcomes we re-calculated the effect size if ITT had not been used. When making the calculations, if there was good evidence that those participants who ceased to engage in the study were likely to have an unfavourable outcome, early withdrawals were included in both the numerator and denominator. Adverse effects were entered into Review Manager as reported by the study authors because it is usually not possible to determine whether early withdrawals had an unfavourable outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultation with another reviewer or members of the guideline development group (GDG) was used to overcome difficulties with coding. Data from studies included in existing systematic reviews were extracted independently by one reviewer and cross-checked with the existing data set. Double data extraction of new data was only undertaken for studies reporting very large effect sizes. Masked assessment (that is, blind to the journal from which the article comes, the authors, the institution and the magnitude of the effect) was not used since it is unclear that doing so reduces bias.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Synthesising the Evidence from Comparative Effectiveness Studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outcome Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many studies include a wide range of outcome measures from different sources (researchers, parents, teachers, clinicians and self) to explore the clinical and social benefits of interventions for conduct disorders. In addition to being of research interest, this wider approach to outcomes mirrors the breadth of contexts within which conduct disordered behaviour is presented, although this heterogeneity brings challenges in determining the relative reliability of measures made by different categories of informant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of the meta-analyses, the GDG established a list of outcomes that it rated as critical and focused on these when making recommendations. For children and young people this included the following outcome categories: agency contact (for example residential care, criminal justice system); antisocial behaviour (at home, at school, in the community); drug/alcohol use, educational attainment (that is, the highest level of education completed); offending behaviour; and, school exclusion due to antisocial behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For each outcome category, where available, data were extracted for parent-, teacher-, researcher/clinician-, and observer-reported outcomes. Only outcome measures that were judged to be established and valid were used in the analysis; less recognised measures, for instance those developed for a particular study were therefore not used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta-Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where possible, meta-analysis was used to synthesise evidence from comparative effectiveness studies using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, Version 2.2.048 and Stata, Version 9.2. If necessary, re-analyses of the data or sub-analyses were used to answer review questions not addressed in the original studies or reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dichotomous outcomes were analysed as relative risks (RR) with the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) (see Figure 1 in the full version of the original guideline document for an example of a forest plot displaying dichotomous data). A relative risk (also called a risk ratio) is the ratio of the treatment event rate to the control event rate. An RR of 1 indicates no difference between treatment and control. In Figure 1 (in the full version of the original guideline document), the overall RR of 0.73 indicates that the event rate (that is, non-remission rate) associated with intervention A is about three-quarters of that with the control intervention or, in other words, the relative risk reduction is 27%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The CI shows a range of values within which we are 95% confident that the true effect will lie. If the effect size has a CI that does not cross the &quot;line of no effect&quot;, then the effect is commonly interpreted as being statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Continuous outcomes were analysed using the standardised mean difference (SMD) when different measures were used in different studies to estimate the same underlying effect (see Figure 2 in the full version of the original guideline document for an example of a forest plot displaying continuous data). If reported by study authors, ITT data, using a valid method for imputation of missing data, were preferred over data only from people who completed the study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the outcomes of interest have often been measured using different scales within a single study, and the GDG were interested in the effect of an intervention when rated by different people (for example observer and parent), the following procedures were employed. First, relevant data were categorised by rater (that is, observer, researcher/clinician, teacher, parent, self). Second, within each rater category, data from multiple outcomes were pooled using comprehensive meta-analysis (one effect size per study for post-treatment results, and where available, another effect size for the longest follow-up). These data were transferred to Stata, which was used to synthesise results across studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heterogeneity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To check for consistency of effects among studies, both the &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; statistic and the chi-squared test of heterogeneity, as well as a visual inspection of the forest plots were used. The &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; statistic describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. The &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; statistic was interpreted in the follow way based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;0% to 40%: might not be important &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two factors were used to make a judgement about importance of the observed value of &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: (1) the magnitude and direction of effects, and (2) the strength of evidence for heterogeneity (for example &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; value from the chi-squared test, or a confidence interval for &lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where important heterogeneity was detected, random effects univariate meta-regression models were used to examine whether any reported factors explained any of the variance. We then created a multivariate meta-regression model including all factors that were shown in the univariate models to explain at least some of the variance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To examine how much of the heterogeneity was accounted for by the factor(s) included in each model, we used the adjusted &lt;em&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; produced by the revised metareg command in Stata. Sensitivity analyses were also used to explore the effect of removing studies with high risk of bias, and studies of attenuated interventions (that is, those interventions judged by the GDG to be very brief or because they were self-administered versions of an intervention usually administered by a therapist/researcher).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication Bias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG assessed the possibility of publication bias using the Stata metabias command. Where there was evidence of significant asymmetry in the funnel plot (as judged by the Begg and Mazumdar adjusted rank correlation test), the Stata metatrim command was used to perform the Duval and Tweedie nonparametric &quot;trim and fill&quot; method. This method was used to examine the impact of the missing studies by adjusting the meta-analysis to take into account the theoretically missing studies. We only report these data were possible publication bias was detected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Synthesising the Evidence from Test Accuracy Studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta-Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Review Manager 5 was used to summarise test accuracy data from each study using forest plots and summary receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plots. Where more than two studies reported appropriate data, a bivariate test accuracy meta-analysis was conducted using Meta-DiSc in order to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensitivity and Specificity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sensitivity of an instrument refers to probability that it will produce a true positive result when given to a population with the target disorder (as compared with a reference or &quot;gold standard&quot;). An instrument that detects a low percentage of cases will not be very helpful in determining the numbers of service users who should receive further assessment or a known effective treatment, because many individuals who should receive the treatment will not do so. This would lead to an under-estimation of the prevalence of the disorder, contribute to inadequate care and make for poor planning and costing of the need for treatment. As the sensitivity of an instrument increases, the number of false negatives it detects will decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The specificity of an instrument refers to the probability that a test will produce a true negative result when given to a population without the target disorder (as determined by a reference or &quot;gold standard&quot;). This is important so that healthy people are not offered further assessment or treatments they do not need. As the specificity of an instrument increases, the number of false positives will decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When describing the sensitivity and specificity of the different instruments, the GDG defined values above 0.9 as &quot;excellent&quot;, 0.8 to 0.9 as &quot;good&quot;, 0.5 to 0.7 as &quot;moderate&quot;, 0.3 to 0.4 as &quot;low&quot;, and less than 0.3 as &quot;poor&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The qualities of a particular tool are summarised in a ROC curve, which plots sensitivity (expressed as a per cent) against (100-specificity) (see Figure 3 in the full version of the original guideline document).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A test with perfect discrimination would have an ROC curve that passed through the top left hand corner; that is, it would have 100% specificity and pick up all true positives with no false positives. While this is never achieved in practice, the area under the curve (AUC) measures how close the tool gets to the theoretical ideal. A perfect test would have an AUC of 1, and a test with AUC above 0.5 is better than chance. As discussed above, because these measures are based on sensitivity and 100-specificity, theoretically these estimates are not affected by prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative and Positive Likelihood Ratios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Negative and positive likelihood ratios are thought not to be dependent on prevalence. The positive likelihood ratio is calculated by sensitivity/(1-specificity) and negative likelihood ratio is (1-sensitivity)/specificity. A positive likelihood ratio with a value of &amp;gt;5 and a negative likelihood ratio of &amp;lt;0.3 suggests the test is relatively accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthesising the Evidence from Studies About the Experience of Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Themes from evidence about the experience of care were collated using the matrix of service user experience developed for the service user guidance and quality standard. The matrix was formed by creating a table with the eight dimensions of patient-centred care developed by the Picker Institute Europe (see Appendix 13 in the full version of the original guideline document for more information), down the vertical axis, and the key points on a pathway of care (as specified by the GDG) across the horizontal axis (see Table 5 in the full version of the original guideline document). With regard to terminology, the service user experience guidance used the term &quot;person-centred&quot; rather than &quot;patient-centred&quot;, therefore the former is used in the matrix.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Picker Institute's dimensions of patient-centred care were chosen because they are well established, comprehensive, and based on research. In addition, a variation of these dimensions has been adopted by the US Institute of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Themes evident within the matrix were used during a consultation undertaken with a focus group (User Voice, see Section 4.2.5., in the full version of the original guideline document; see Appendix 14 in the full version of the original guideline document for a description of the methods used). In addition, the evidence obtained from the reviews was used to inform the process of incorporation and adaptation of existing guideline recommendations where there was insufficient evidence to support the development of recommendations in areas the GDG considered to be important (see Sections 4.3. and 3.7., in the full version of the original guideline document, for a description of the methods used).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Health Economic Methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the health economics was to contribute to the guideline's development by providing evidence on the cost effectiveness of interventions for conduct disorders in children and young people covered in the guideline. This was achieved by:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Systematic literature review of existing economic evidence &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Economic modelling, where economic evidence was lacking or was&amp;nbsp;considered inadequate to inform decisions &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Systematic reviews of economic literature were conducted in all areas covered in the guideline. Economic modelling was undertaken in areas with likely major resource implications, where the current extent of uncertainty over cost effectiveness was significant and economic analysis was expected to reduce this uncertainty, in accordance with The Guidelines Manual (NICE, 2009b; see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Prioritisation of areas for economic modelling was a joint decision between the Health Economist and the GDG. The rationale for prioritising review questions for economic modelling was set out in an economic plan agreed between NICE, the GDG, the Health Economist and the other members of the technical team. The following economic questions were selected as key issues that were addressed by economic modelling:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;What is the cost-effectiveness of child-focused interventions for children and young people with conduct disorder? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;What is the cost-effectiveness of parent-focused interventions for children and young people with conduct disorder? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;What is the cost-effectiveness of multi-modal interventions for children and young people with conduct disorder? &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, literature on the health-related quality of life of children and young people with a conduct disorder was systematically searched to identify studies reporting appropriate utility scores that could be utilised in a cost-utility analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Methods employed in economic modelling are described in the respective sections of the guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Guideline Development Group (GDG)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the consultation phase, members of the GDG were appointed by an open recruitment process. GDG membership consisted of: professionals in psychiatry, clinical psychology, nursing, social care, and general practice; academic experts in psychiatry and psychology; and carers of children and young people with a conduct disorder. The guideline development process was supported by staff from the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH), who undertook the clinical and health economics literature searches, reviewed and presented the evidence to the GDG, managed the process, and contributed to drafting the guideline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guideline Development Group Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Twelve GDG meetings were held between 13 April 2011 and 31 October 2012. During each day-long GDG meeting, in a plenary session, review questions and clinical and economic evidence were reviewed and assessed, and recommendations formulated. At each meeting, all GDG members declared any potential conflicts of interest, and service user and carer concerns were routinely discussed as a standing agenda item.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GDG divided its workload along clinically relevant lines to simplify the guideline development process, and GDG members formed smaller topic groups to undertake guideline work in that area of clinical practice. Topic Group 1 covered questions relating to prevention. Topic Group 2 covered interventions and Topic Group 3 covered health economics. These groups were designed to efficiently manage the large volume of evidence appraisal prior to presenting it to the GDG as a whole. Each topic group was chaired by a GDG member with expert knowledge of the topic area (one of the healthcare professionals). Topic groups refined the review questions and the clinical definitions of treatment interventions, reviewed and prepared the evidence with the systematic reviewer before presenting it to the GDG as a whole, and helped the GDG to identify further expertise in the topic. Topic group leaders reported the status of the group's work as part of the standing agenda. They also introduced and led the GDG discussion of the evidence review for that topic and assisted the GDG Chair in drafting the section of the guideline relevant to the work of each topic group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Users and Carers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with direct experience of services gave an integral service-user focus to the GDG and the guideline. The GDG included two carers, who contributed as full GDG members to writing the review questions, helping to ensure that the evidence addressed their views and preferences, highlighting sensitive issues and terminology relevant to the guideline, and bringing service-user research to the attention of the GDG. In drafting the guideline, they contributed to writing the guideline's introduction and identified recommendations from the service user and carer perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National and International Experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;National and international experts in the area under review were identified through the literature search and through the experience of the GDG members. These experts were contacted to identify unpublished or soon-to-be published studies, to ensure that up-to-date evidence was included in the development of the guideline. They informed the group about completed trials at the pre-publication stage, systematic reviews in the process of being published, studies relating to the cost effectiveness of treatment and trial data if the GDG could be provided with full access to the complete trial report. Appendix 4 in the full version of the original guideline document lists researchers who were contacted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Review Questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Review (clinical) questions were used to guide the identification and interrogation of the evidence base relevant to the topic of the guideline. Before the first GDG meeting, draft review questions were prepared by NCCMH staff based on the scope and an overview of existing guidelines, and discussed with the GDG Chair. The draft review questions were then discussed by the GDG at the first few meetings and amended as necessary. Where appropriate, the questions were refined once the evidence had been searched and, where necessary, sub-questions were generated. Questions submitted by stakeholders were also discussed by the GDG and the rationale for not including any questions was recorded in the minutes. The final list of review questions can be found in Appendix 5 in the full version of the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For questions about interventions, the PICO (population, intervention, comparison and outcome) framework was used (see Table 3 in the full version of the original guideline document).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions relating to case identification do not involve an intervention designed to treat a particular condition; therefore, the PICO framework was not used. Rather, the questions were designed to pick up key issues specifically relevant to clinical utility, for example their accuracy, reliability, safety and acceptability to the service user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some situations, the prognosis of a particular condition is of fundamental importance, over and above its general significance in relation to specific interventions. Areas where this is particularly likely to occur relate to assessment of risk, for example in terms of behaviour modification or screening and early intervention. In addition, review questions related to issues of service delivery are occasionally specified in the remit from the Department of Health/Welsh Assembly Government. In these cases, appropriate review questions were developed to be clear and concise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To help facilitate the literature review, a note was made of the best study design type to answer each question. There are four main types of review question of relevance to NICE guidelines. These are listed in Table 4 in the full version of the original guideline document. For each type of question, the best primary study design varies, where &quot;best&quot; is interpreted as &quot;least likely to give misleading answers to the question&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in all cases, a well-conducted systematic review (of the appropriate type of study) is likely to always yield a better answer than a single study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deciding on the best design type to answer a specific review question does not mean that studies of different design types addressing the same question were discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Extrapolation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When answering review questions, it may be necessary to consider extrapolating from another data set where direct evidence from a primary data set is not available. In this situation, the following principles were used to determine when to extrapolate:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A primary dataset is absent, of low quality or is judged to be not relevant to the review question under consideration &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A review question is deemed by the GDG to be important, such that in the absence of direct evidence other data sources should be considered &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A non-primary data source(s) is in the view of the GDG available which may inform the review question &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the decision to extrapolate was made, the following principles were used to inform the choice of the non-primary data set:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The populations (usually in relation to the specified diagnosis or problem which characterises the population) under consideration share some common characteristic but differ in other ways, such as age, gender or in the nature of the disorder (for example a common behavioural problem; acute versus chronic presentations of the same disorder) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The interventions under consideration in the view of the GDG have one or more of the following characteristics:&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Share a common mode of action (for example the pharmacodynamics of â¨drug; a common psychological model of change &amp;ndash; operant conditioning) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Be feasible to deliver in both populations (for example in terms of the â¨required skills or the demands of the health care system) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Share common side effects/harms in both populations &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The context or comparator involved in the evaluation of the different data sets shares some common elements which support extrapolation &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The outcomes involved in the evaluation of the different data sets shares some common elements which support extrapolation (for example improved mood or a reduction in challenging behaviour) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the choice of the non-primary data set was made, the following principles were used to guide the application of extrapolation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The GDG should first consider the need for extrapolation through a review of the relevant primary data set and be guided in these decisions by the principles for the use of extrapolation &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;In all areas of extrapolation data sets should be assessed against the principles for determining the choice of data sets. In general, the criteria in the four principles set out above for determining the choice should be met &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;In deciding on the use of extrapolation, the GDG will have to determine if the extrapolation can be held to be reasonable, including ensuring that:&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The reasoning behind the decision can be justified by the clinical need for a â¨recommendation to be made &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The absence of other more direct evidence, and by the relevance of the â¨potential data set to the review question can be establishedâ¨ &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The reasoning and the method adopted is clearly set out in the relevant section of the guideline &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method Used to Answer a Review Question in the Absence of Appropriately Designed, High-Quality Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of appropriately designed, high-quality research, or where the GDG were of the opinion (on the basis of previous searches or their knowledge of the literature) that there were unlikely to be such evidence, an informal consensus process was adopted. The process involved a group discussion of what is known about the issues. The views of GDG were synthesised narratively, and circulated after the meeting. Feedback was used to revise the text, which was then included in the appropriate evidence review chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Healthcare professionals are expected to take it fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. However, the guidance does not override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual patient, in consultation with the patient and/or guardian or carer, and informed by the summaries of product characteristics of any drugs. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Implementation of this guidance is the responsibility of local commissioners and/or providers. Commissioners and providers are reminded that it is their responsibility to implement the guidance, in their local context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this guidance should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with compliance with those duties. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Service users and healthcare professionals have rights and responsibilities as set out in the NHS Constitution for England &amp;ndash; all NICE guidance is written to reflect these. Treatment and care should take into account individual needs and preferences. Service users should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals. If someone does not have the capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should follow the Department of Health's advice on consent and the code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act and the supplementary code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards. In Wales, healthcare professionals should follow advice on consent from the Welsh Government. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Some recommendations in this guideline have been adapted from recommendations in other NICE&amp;nbsp;clinical guidance. In these cases the Guideline Development Group was careful to preserve the meaning and intent of the original recommendations. Changes to wording or structure were made to fit the recommendations into this guideline. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The guideline assumes that prescribers will use a drug's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual service users. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;This guideline recommends some drugs for indications for which they do not have a UK marketing authorisation at the date of publication, if there is good evidence to support that use. The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. The service user (or those with authority to give consent on their behalf) should provide informed consent, which should be documented. See the General Medical Council's Good practice in prescribing and managing medicines and devices for further information. Where recommendations have been made for the use of drugs outside their licensed indications ('off-label use'), these drugs are marked with a footnote in the recommendations. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
