If studies fulfilled the other inclusion criteria, but data for 2x2 tables was not available, the External Assessment Group members reported what data were available, such as calprotectin ranges, medians, and interquartile ranges (IQRs), to compare groups with different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In papers where the numbers of true and false positives and negatives were not reported, but data on sensitivity and specificity and the total numbers of people with and without disease was reported, the data for the 2x2 table were calculated using the Calculator function in RevMan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Data on five covariates, including faecal calprotectin cut-off level, make of test, age (adult or paediatric), setting (primary or secondary care), and type of test (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] or point-of-care test [POCT]) were extracted for each study and entered into Review Manager (RevMan).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RevMan version 5.2 was used for data entry and analysis to generate forest plots. MedCalc version 12.3.0 for producing statistical data based on the 2x2 tables, including positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and disease prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies that provided sufficient data for calculation of sensitivity, specificity and other diagnostic outcomes were identified, and data was entered into Review Manager version 5.2 for the generation of paired forest plots and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Further statistical analysis was performed in Stata 12 (StataCorp, 4905 Lakeway Drive, College Station, Texas 77845 USA) to produce likelihood ratios, area under the curve (AUC) and nomograms. The intention was to examine the performance of calprotectin testing over a range of values, starting with the level recommended by the manufacturers, which is most often 50 &amp;mu;g/g. Where sufficient studies reported results at the same values, the Assessment Group aimed to pool data for each value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meta-analysis was performed in accordance with previously reported guidelines for meta-analyses of diagnostic tests using the Stata command Metandi. Pooled estimates for values among different diagnoses were obtained with 95% confidence intervals, assuming a Bivariate model. If there were sufficient studies, The Assessment Group planned to pool data at the same cut-off levels from ELISA and POCT tests separately, and compare them. However only ELISA tests were pooled.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quality assessment of studies was done using items adapted from the QUADAS I tool (in protocol as approved by NICE) (see the DAR for a list of quality assessment questions used).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;quality assessment&quot; is preferred to the more traditional &quot;risk of bias&quot; term because the latter, as used in systematic reviews such as Cochrane ones, is more associated with assessing internal validity of randomised controlled trials. The Assessment Group need to assess external validity through items such a spectrum bias.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All data extractions and quality assessments were done by one author and checked by another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Appendix 4 in the DAR for the quality assessment table.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Economics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A review of the cost-effectiveness literature for faecal calprotectin testing was presented. This was followed by a review of studies of quality of life that may be suitable for inclusion in a cost utility analysis of faecal calprotectin testing, health related quality of life for three conditions having to be considered: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Given the centrality of colonoscopy to the question in hand, a brief review of the adverse events associated with colonoscopy was then presented. A relatively simple cost consequence model of faecal calprotectin testing was then presented, augmented by some considerations around the loss of utility among false negatives during their period of incorrect treatment. This was followed by a full cost utility model, much of the structure of this being drawn from the modelling for &lt;em&gt;CG61: Diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome in primary care&lt;/em&gt;; the modelling for &lt;em&gt;CG152: Crohn's disease: Management in adults, children and young people&lt;/em&gt;; and the modelling for the current draft of the ulcerative colitis guideline: &lt;em&gt;Ulcerative colitis: management in adults, children and young people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to section 3 in the DAR for a full description of the economic evaluation performed by the External Assessment Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the evidence the Diagnostic Advisory Committee (DAC) agrees draft recommendations on the use of the technology in the National Health Service (NHS) in England. When formulating these recommendations, the Committee has discretion to consider those factors it believes are most appropriate to the evaluation. In doing so, the Committee has regard to any relevant provisions of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) Directions, set out by the Secretary of State for Health, and legislation on human rights, discrimination and equality. In undertaking evaluations of healthcare technologies, NICE takes into account the broad balance of clinical benefits and costs, the degree of clinical need of patients under consideration, any guidance issued to the NHS by the Secretary of State that is specifically drawn to the attention of NICE by the Secretary of State, and any guidance issued by the Secretary of State, and the potential for long-term benefits to the NHS of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee takes into account advice from NICE on the approach it should take to making scientific and social value judgements. Advice on social value judgements is informed in part by the work of NICE's Citizens Council.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee takes into account how its judgements have a bearing on distributive justice or legal requirements in relation to human rights, discrimination and equality. Such characteristics include, but are not confined to: race, gender, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation, gender reassignment and pregnancy or maternity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee considers the application of other Board-approved NICE methods policies, such as the supplementary guidance on discounting and the end-of-life criteria, if they are relevant to the evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the Programme often evaluates new technologies that have a thin evidence base, in formulating its recommendations the Committee balances the quality and quantity of evidence with the expected value of the technology to the NHS and the public.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The credibility of the guidance produced by NICE depends on the transparency of the DAC's decision-making process. It is crucial that the DAC's decisions are explained clearly, and that the contributions of registered stakeholders and the views of members of the public are considered. The reasoning behind the Committee's recommendations is explained, with reference to the factors that have been taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The language and style used in the documents produced by the Committee are governed by the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Clarity is essential in explaining how the DAC has come to its conclusions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The text of the documents does not need to reiterate all the factual information that can be found in the information published alongside the guidance. This needs careful judgement so that enough information and justification is given in the recommendations to enable the reader to understand what evidence the DAC considered and, if appropriate, who provided that evidence. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee may take into account factors that may provide benefits to the NHS or the population, such as patient convenience. It may also consider costs and other positive or negative impacts on the NHS that may not be captured in the reference-case cost analysis, such as improved processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Although previous economic analyses have typically concluded that faecal calprotectin testing is cost saving compared with diagnostic pathway costs without it, several issues were highlighted in the critique of the literature, which need further consideration. These included: the use of a small sample size to inform the analysis; assumptions about test accuracy and no consideration of false negative results; the analysis considering colonoscopy but not faecal calprotectin testing; studies that were conducted in England but in primary care only; and some studies that were available only in abstract/poster format, which did not allow for a full critique of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Cost-effectiveness Model Constructed by the External Assessment Group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Aim&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the scope allowed for the assessment of faecal calprotectin testing for both adults and children in both primary and secondary care, the External Assessment Group modelled 2 specific populations: an adult population in primary care, with faecal calprotectin test accuracies for inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBD) compared with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and a paediatric population in secondary care, with faecal calprotectin test accuracies for IBD compared with non-IBD. The External Assessment Group believed these populations reflect the most likely use of faecal calprotectin testing in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main aim of the model was to assess the impact of faecal calprotectin testing when added to current clinical practice compared with current practice alone on the differentiation of IBD and IBS in primary care. This model was then adjusted to reflect the differing test performances and costs in the paediatric population to provide an approximation of the cost effectiveness of faecal calprotectin testing for distinguishing between IBD and non-IBD. However, the External Assessment Group highlighted the limitation of this approach because the main model structure does not fully account for the non-IBD case mix in the paediatric population (prevalence of IBS in the non-IBD group is lower than that seen in adults).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base-Case Cost-effectiveness Results &amp;ndash; Primary Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without faecal calprotectin testing, general practitioner (GP) current practice is highly sensitive in terms of referring people with IBD and is as good as, if not better, than faecal calprotectin testing. Of the 6.3% of people with IBD in the total population, all were identified by the GP current practice strategy and the point-of-care test (POCT) CalDetect strategy. Colonoscopy would correctly identify 6.0% of the 6.3% referred as patients with true positive results (because of its 95% sensitivity), resulting in a total of 0.3% of patients with false negative results. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing is slightly worse, identifying 5.9% of the 6.3% (because of its lower sensitivity when compared with current practice and the POCT), with 0.4% of patients being classified as having false negative results. Of the 5.9% referred for colonoscopy, 5.6% of patients would be identified as having true positive results, with 0.3% being classified as having false negative results, resulting in a total of 0.7% of patients with false negative results. Therefore, a slightly larger number of people will have IBD but will be incorrectly diagnosed as having IBS when using an ELISA testing strategy when compared with current practice strategy and a POCT CalDetect strategy (0.7% compared with 0.3%).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within the total patient population, GP current practice incorrectly identified 19.8% of patients as having false positive results (people thought to have IBD but who actually have IBS) and requiring referral for colonoscopy. The rates of patients with false positive results incorrectly referred for colonoscopy for POCT CalDetect and ELISA were much lower, at 5.1% and 5.6% respectively. Therefore, without faecal calprotectin testing, many of the patients with false positive results would go on to have a colonoscopy, which has a risk (although low) of serious complications such as perforation. Such events are too rare to significantly affect costs, but they do have some quality-adjusted life year (QALY) impact. This is also true for the more common minor adverse effects of colonoscopy (which were not explicitly considered in the model because of a lack of data).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Table 3 in the original guideline document for base-case per patient costs and QALYs in primary care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The faecal calprotectin tests were estimated to result in similar average cost savings compared with GP current practice: &amp;pound;83 for the POCT CalDetect and &amp;pound;82 for ELISA per patient. This was mainly because of the lower number of referrals and colonoscopies for false positive results. Average QALY gains of around 0.0007 QALYs were also accrued, although these were limited because the low prevalence of IBD and the similar high sensitivities of the tests resulted in relatively few false negative results. Therefore, the faecal calprotectin testing strategies dominated current practice (provided greater benefit at reduced cost). Some of the QALY differences accrued were from the very slightly lower mortality associated with the lower number of colonoscopies. The POCT CalDetect and ELISA strategies were estimated to be broadly equivalent in terms of costs and QALYs, with only minor differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base-Case Cost-effectiveness Results &amp;ndash; Secondary Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The base-case prevalence of IBD of 47.9% increased the importance of test sensitivities compared with the primary care setting, and so the effect of false negative results on the modelling outputs. Within the total patient population, ELISA with the 50 &amp;micro;g/g cut-off led to 47.4% of patients with true positive results being referred for colonoscopy, while ELISA with the 100 &amp;micro;g/g cut-off led to 45.0% of patients with true positive results being referred for colonoscopy. Colonoscopy was assumed to have a sensitivity of 95%. So, if all (47.9%) patients were referred immediately for colonoscopy, 45.5% would be diagnosed with IBD. With ELISA with the 50 micrograms/g cut-off, 45.0% of the 47.4% of patients referred for colonoscopy were diagnosed as having IBD, while 42.8% of the 45.0% of patients referred for colonoscopy after ELISA with the 100 &amp;micro;g/g cut-off were diagnosed as having IBD; a net difference between the cut-offs of 2.2%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite the higher IBD prevalence in the secondary care population, the main test differences still lay in the number of unnecessary colonoscopies. Without faecal calprotectin testing, all 52.1% of patients without IBD received a colonoscopy, compared with 13.5% for ELISA with the 50 &amp;micro;g/g cut-off and only 9.4% for ELISA with the 100 &amp;micro;g/g cut-off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Table 5 in the original guideline document for the base-case per patient costs and QALYs in secondary care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior testing using ELISA was estimated to dominate (provided greater benefit at reduced cost) the strategy of sending all patients directly for colonoscopy. Compared with referring all patients directly for colonoscopy, ELISA used at the 50 &amp;micro;g/g cut-off was estimated to save &amp;pound;205 per patient, while ELISA used at the 100 &amp;micro;g/g cut-off was estimated to save &amp;pound;240 per patient. QALY gains of around 0.001 QALYs were estimated for ELISA compared with direct referral for colonoscopy, these being slightly larger for ELISA with the 50 &amp;micro;g/g cut-off because of its better sensitivity. The additional average cost of &amp;pound;35 and additional average QALYs of 0.0001 for ELISA with the 50 &amp;micro;g/g cut-off compared with ELISA with the 100 &amp;micro;g/g cut-off resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of &amp;pound;35,000 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Sections 5 and 6 in the original guideline document for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
