Standard errors and confidence intervals were converted to standard deviations using the equations provided in the Cochrane handbook. Results for lipids were expressed as mmol/L. Cholesterol values expressed in mg/dL were converted to mmol/L by dividing by 38.67 and lipid values expressed in mg/dL were converted to mmol/L by dividing by 88.57.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Data were summarised using text and tables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following subgroup analyses were considered:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Body mass index (BMI) &amp;lt;25, 25-29, 30 and over &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Baseline glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Meta-analysis of Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors and Comparators in Monotherapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the network meta-analysis (NMA) was not only to compare canagliflozin, empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, but also to assess their effects relative to active comparators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Synthesis and Model Implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Assessment Group (AG) used a Bayesian network meta-analysis method to analyse all the data, preserving randomized treatment effects within trials and accounting for correlation between comparisons with three-arms or four-arms using the freely available software, WinBUGS 1.4.3. The statistical heterogeneity in treatment effect estimates was estimated using between study variance (i.e., square root of the standard deviation of underlying effects across trials) with 95% credible interval (CrI). To estimate inconsistency in the networks of evidence, the AG calculated the difference between indirect and direct estimates whenever indirect estimates could be constructed with a single common comparator. Inconsistency was defined as disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with a 95% CrI excluding 0 for mean difference (MD). The model convergence was assessed using trace plots and the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistic. The analysis was undertaken using two Markov chains, which was run simultaneously. The model was found to be converging adequately after 20,000 samples for both chains. The AG ran the model further using 70,000 samples and the results presented in the paper are based on these samples as the AG discarded the first 20,000 samples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both the fixed and random effect models were used. The Bayesian Deviation Information Criterion (DIC) was used to compare the two models to see which was appropriate to compare treatment effects. The DIC measures the fit of the model while penalizing it for the number of effective parameters. The model with the lowest DIC value was considered as the most appropriate NMA model. Based on DIC values obtained from the two models and also because of small number of studies available for the NMA, a fixed effect model was chosen. Due to small number of studies, it would have been difficult to estimate between studies variance if a random effect model was implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All results are reported as posterior medians of MDs with corresponding 95% CrIs. CrIs are the Bayesian equivalent of classic confidence intervals. A 95% CrI can be interpreted as there being a 95% probability that the parameter takes a value in the specified range. Drugs were not ranked, but were considered in terms of effect sizes and uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Chapters 2 and 3 of the Assessment Report for additional information on clinical effectiveness and network meta-analysis, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturers of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, and the AG submitted economic models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company Submissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the submissions contain modelling exercises with long term time horizons of around 40 years, which for the majority of patients will be a lifetime horizon. They all undertake a cost utility analysis using the appropriate perspectives of the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) for costs and the patient for benefits, and discount costs and benefits at 3.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Boehringer Ingelheim designed a front end to the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model 1 (UKPDS OM1) model. The Boehringer Ingelheim submission has a great deal in common with the modelling of recent NICE clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the AG modelling for the current assessment, both of which design a front end to the UKPDS OM1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Astrazeneca uses the CARDIFF diabetes model (CDM) which uses many of the UKPDS68 equations and so has much in common with the UKPDS OM1 model, but updates the calculation of the probabilities of having an event to use the UKPDS82 which is the basis of the OM2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Janssen differs from Astrazeneca and Boehringer Ingelheim in using the Economic and Health Outcomes Model for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (ECHO-T2DM) model. Its base case has assumptions which differ quite noticeably from those of the other two submissions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Chapter 5 of the Assessment Report for details on manufacturers' models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessment Group Economic Modelling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The protocol specified that either the UKPDS OM1 or the UKPDS OM2 would be used by the AG. For some of its outputs the OM1 is quite different from the OM2 in its predictions. But the OM2 was not made available to the AG in time for the assessment and so as specified in the protocol the OM1 has been used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The OM1 was used for the modelling that underlies the NICE clinical guideline (CG) for diabetes (see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline &lt;a href=&quot;/summaries/summary/49931/&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10856&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Type 2 diabetes in adults: management&lt;/a&gt;). During its development the Guideline Development Group (GDG) reviewed in detail ten T2DM cost-effectiveness models. These included the JADE and CORE models, but not the ECHO-T2DM model. Based upon validation and consistency with the NICE reference case the GDG very much preferred the OM1, in no small part due to it being based upon a single RCT rather than drawing a range of modelling inputs from disparate sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AG has developed a front and back end to the OM1. Briefly, for each patient and treatment strategy that is simulated the AG front end models the patient's progression from monotherapy through the various treatment intensifications over a 40 year time horizon in annual cycles. This in turn introduces the patient's evolutions of HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), total cholesterol:high density lipoprotein (TC:HDL), BMI, hypoglycaemia event rates, adverse events and treatment costs. The evolutions of the patient's HbA1c, SBP and TC:HDL are then fed into the OM1 which models the complications of diabetes and patient lifespan, and outputs the costs and quality of life impacts of living with diabetes and the patient's survival curve. The AG back end takes the OM1 survival curve and uses this to condition the evolutions of the patient's BMI, hypoglycaemia event rates, adverse events and treatment costs. The cost and quality of life impacts of these are then summed with the cost and quality of life impacts outputted by the OM1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In slightly more detail, patients start on monotherapy but intensify their treatment if their HbA1c is modelled as breaching the 7.5% threshold. Intensifications typically add another treatment to a patient's existing treatment(s). This permits treatment sequences to be modelled, starting with monotherapy but with subsequent treatment intensifications, these intensifications eventually leading to first basal insulin and then basal-bolus insulin. Each treatment within a sequence is associated with treatment costs, weight changes, hypoglycaemic events and adverse events. The AG modelling also permits treatments to be associated with a discontinuation rate in their first year, with patients who discontinue being assumed to switch to another treatment at the same line of therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Chapter 5 of the Assessment Report for more information on model structure and cost-effectiveness analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'Assessment Report. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the Appraisal Consultation Document (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the Final Appraisal Determination (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The committee concluded there was uncertainty about the reason for the favourable cost-effectiveness results for canagliflozin compared with a sulfonylurea in the manufacturer's model, but that the increased costs arising from retaining oral treatments (a committee preferred assumption) was likely to be an important contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee noted that the small QALY differences between treatments made the ICERs unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporation of Health-related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The committee noted that there were generally very small QALY differences between the various treatments. It also noted that the AG had presented a number of scenarios varying the impact of body mass index (BMI) on quality of life. Overall the committee agreed that weight loss does affect quality of life and that the evidence had shown that SGLT-2 inhibitors do have a significant effect on weight loss. It noted that National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) guideline on diabetes (see the NGC summary of the NICE guideline &lt;a href=&quot;/summaries/summary/49931/&quot; title=&quot;Guideline #10856&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Type 2 diabetes in adults: management&lt;/a&gt;) used the same assumption for the duration of weight gains and losses as that used in scenario BMI-2. It concluded that BMI-2 was the most plausible scenario, but noted that the small QALY differences between treatments made the ICERs unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No specific committee consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key driver of cost-effectiveness was the BMI scenario chosen. The committee concluded that BMI-2 was the most plausible scenario, but noted that the small QALY differences between treatments made the ICERs unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the SGLT-2 inhibitors were compared with each other, the committee agreed that the clinical and cost evidence did not support any differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When compared with pioglitazone, ICERs for all the SGLT-2 inhibitors were more than &amp;pound;52,400 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When compared with sulfonylureas, ICERs for the SGLT-2 inhibitors were all more than &amp;pound;71,000 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, the ICERs ranged from &amp;pound;3,600 to &amp;pound;29,300 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
