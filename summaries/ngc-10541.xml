Details of the development of a national registry are included in Section 7 in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Metasin test is not recommended for detecting sentinel lymph node metastases in people with early invasive breast cancer in routine clinical National Health Service (NHS) practice.

The searches did not use any form of limit (e.g., date).

For the purpose of this review, a systematic review was defined as one that has:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A focused research question &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Explicit search criteria that are available to review, either in the document or on application &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria, defining the population(s), intervention(s), comparator(s), and outcome(s) of interest &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A critical appraisal of included studies, including consideration of internal and external validity of the research &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A synthesis of the included evidence, whether narrative or quantitative &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies were excluded if they did not match the inclusion criteria, and in particular were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Pre-clinical and animal &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Reviews, editorials and opinion pieces &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Case reports &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Studies with &amp;lt;10 participants &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, no study design was excluded unless evidence on the intervention and outcome of interest is already available from study designs less open to bias as judged with reference to standard hierarchies of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Appendix 3 in the DAR for detailed description of search strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Assessment of Cost-effectiveness: Systematic Review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systematic Review of Existing Cost-effectiveness Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Assessment Group reviewed published economic evaluations of intraoperative molecular assessment for metastasis in early breast cancer to identify evidence relevant to current National Health Service (NHS) practice. In addition to electronic databases searched in the effectiveness section, the NHS Health Economic Evaluation Database (NHS HEED) and EconLit were searched for cost, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility studies. Forward citations of identified studies were searched for any relevant publications published after the initial search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Relevant studies were then identified in two stages. Titles and abstracts returned by the search strategy were examined independently by two researchers and screened for possible inclusion. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Full texts of the identified studies were obtained. Two researchers examined these independently for inclusion or exclusion, and disagreements were resolved by discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Disagreements were resolved by discussion, with involvement of a third reviewer if necessary. Data extraction forms for each included study can be found in Appendix 4 in the DAR.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critical Appraisal Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The methodological quality of the studies was assessed, where applicable to the design of the study, according to criteria specified by the &lt;em&gt;Cochrane Collaboration's Tool for Assessing Risk of Bias&lt;/em&gt;. The QUADAS-2 was used for test accuracy studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quality was assessed by one reviewer and judgements were checked by a second. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion, with involvement of a third reviewer as necessary. Results were tabulated and the relevant aspects described in the data extraction forms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Sections 4.1.4.1 and 4.1.4.2 in the DAR for information in internal and external validity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods of Data Synthesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Details of the extracted data and quality assessment for each individual study are presented in structured tables and as a narrative description. Any possible effects of study quality on the effectiveness data are discussed. Data on test accuracy are presented as sensitivity, specificity and concordance, where available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Meta-analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy was performed using the bivariate method implemented in Stata/SE 12.1 using the command metandi. Studies were only included in the meta-analysis if the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false negatives and false positives were all reported in the text or could be unambiguously inferred from other figures in the text. Meta-analysis using the full bivariate method was not performed where there were fewer than four included studies as the model cannot generally be estimated with fewer than four studies. Where the full bivariate model could not be estimated (either due to insufficient studies or other convergence errors) the Assessment Group reduced the complexity of the model by setting the correlation parameter to zero (effectively reducing the model to two independent univariate random effects analyses) and performing the analysis directly using the Stata command xtmelogit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bivariate method, when calculated using maximum likelihood estimation and without covariates, is equivalent to the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model and this can be used to provide a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and prediction region as well as a summary estimate and confidence region of sensitivity and specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The SROC curve is designed to show how sensitivity and specificity are traded off against each other in different studies, through variation of the positivity threshold. If, and only if, there is reason to believe the positivity threshold might vary between studies, the Assessment Group provides a SROC curve and prediction region.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 4 in the DAR for additional information on clinical effectiveness analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Assessment of Cost-effectiveness: Systematic Review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systematic Review of Existing Cost-effectiveness Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quality Appraisal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A quality appraisal was carried out on two studies retrieved in the economics literature search, using the Drummond checklist. A summary of the results are provided in Table 39 in the DAR.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent ERG Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main analysis compares OSNA and Metasin with histopathology from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). The evaluation is presented for the outcomes occurring up to the staging the axilla. In addition, a separate analysis evaluated the long-term outcomes of intra-operative testing options in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. The long-term analysis is intended as an illustration of the relative size of benefits of intra-operative diagnosis and the effect of uncertainty on its expected lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Description of Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model is split into two separate sections (diagnostic and management) to encompass both immediate and long-term outcomes. As the technology is expected to have a larger impact on the short-term outcomes, it is this section that the Assessment Group particularly focusses on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnostic Pathway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Patients enter the model as those who have sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) performed during their initial tumour removal. The model then splits into three different strategies, to encompass each of the possible combinations of diagnostic tests: intraoperative only (OSNA or Metasin, not in combination), histopathology only, or a combination of an intraoperative assay and follow up histopathology. These three strategies are shown in Figure 14 in the DAR. In the following descriptions, positive test results refer to results that indicate metastases in the sentinel lymph node. The three modelled pathways are therefore:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Current practice: SLNB is analysed using histopathology of the full node. If positive for metastases a second surgery is performed where axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) occurs. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Add in strategy: half of the sentinel lymph node from SLNB is analysed during the tumour removal operation using one of the intraoperative tests (OSNA or Metasin). Those with a positive result receive ALND during that surgery. For those with a negative result, the other half of the sentinel lymph node is kept to be analysed with histopathology. Patients where metastases were not detected at the intraoperative stage, but whose histopathology is positive receive ALND as a second operation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Replacement strategy: the full sentinel lymph node is assessed by the intraoperative test, with no histopathology. Those with a positive result will receive ALND during their tumour removal. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this stage the intermediate costs and patient outcomes are calculated. This analysis was developed in Excel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 5 in the DAR for additional information on the assessment of cost-effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the evidence the Diagnostic Advisory Committee (DAC) agrees draft recommendations on the use of the technology in the National Health Service (NHS) in England. When formulating these recommendations, the Committee has discretion to consider those factors it believes are most appropriate to the evaluation. In doing so, the Committee has regard to any relevant provisions of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) Directions, set out by the Secretary of State for Health, and legislation on human rights, discrimination and equality. In undertaking evaluations of healthcare technologies, NICE takes into account the broad balance of clinical benefits and costs, the degree of clinical need of patients under consideration, any guidance issued to the NHS by the Secretary of State that is specifically drawn to the attention of NICE by the Secretary of State, and any guidance issued by the Secretary of State, and the potential for long-term benefits to the NHS of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee takes into account advice from NICE on the approach it should take to making scientific and social value judgements. Advice on social value judgements is informed in part by the work of NICE's Citizens Council.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee takes into account how its judgements have a bearing on distributive justice or legal requirements in relation to human rights, discrimination and equality. Such characteristics include, but are not confined to: race, gender, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation, gender reassignment and pregnancy or maternity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee considers the application of other Board-approved NICE methods policies, such as the supplementary guidance on discounting and the end-of-life criteria, if they are relevant to the evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the Programme often evaluates new technologies that have a thin evidence base, in formulating its recommendations the Committee balances the quality and quantity of evidence with the expected value of the technology to the NHS and the public.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The credibility of the guidance produced by NICE depends on the transparency of the DAC's decision-making process. It is crucial that the DAC's decisions are explained clearly, and that the contributions of registered stakeholders and the views of members of the public are considered. The reasoning behind the Committee's recommendations is explained, with reference to the factors that have been taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The language and style used in the documents produced by the Committee are governed by the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Clarity is essential in explaining how the DAC has come to its conclusions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The text of the documents does not need to reiterate all the factual information that can be found in the information published alongside the guidance. This needs careful judgement so that enough information and justification is given in the recommendations to enable the reader to understand what evidence the DAC considered and, if appropriate, who provided that evidence. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee may take into account factors that may provide benefits to the NHS or the population, such as patient convenience. It may also consider costs and other positive or negative impacts on the NHS that may not be captured in the reference-case cost analysis, such as improved processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost-effectiveness analyses of the short-term outcomes examined the diagnostic accuracy of the intraoperative tests compared with postoperative, histopathology, and the disutility of waiting for histopathology results and having a second operation. For strategies that did not involve histopathology, the utility was 1 because there was no wait for test results or any second operations directly resulting from the intraoperative test. Only short-term quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains were included in these analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the National Health Service (NHS) reference costs in the short-term model, whole-node OSNA analysis and half-node OSNA analysis dominated histopathology analysis because they were less costly and more effective. Whole-node OSNA analysis also dominated half-node OSNA analysis. It was estimated that 4.1% of the 76.5% of patients who received a negative test result from half-node OSNA analysis would end up with a positive result while waiting for confirmation by histopathology analysis, compared with 20% of patients who would receive a positive result using postoperative histopathology analysis alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the short-term model, whole-node and half-node Metasin analyses dominated histopathology analysis because they were less costly and more effective. Whole-node Metasin also dominated half-node Metasin analysis. It was estimated that, of the 78.5% of patients who received a negative result by half-node Metasin analysis, 1.9% would receive a positive result while waiting for confirmation by histopathology analysis, compared with 20% of patients who would receive a positive result using postoperative histopathology analysis alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cost-effectiveness analyses of the long-term outcomes examined all the costs and benefits from accurate diagnosis through to improved patient management. In these analyses, the diagnostic strategies were ordered by the number of QALYs associated with them, with whole-node OSNA analysis producing the least QALYs (9.22) and postoperative histopathology producing the most QALYs (9.32). The QALY difference is equal to 0.1 (that is, equivalent to 5 weeks of full-health life) and this difference occurs because the higher accuracy of histopathology assumed in the model leads to more correct diagnoses and appropriate subsequent treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the NHS reference costs in the long-term model, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was &amp;pound;4324 saved per QALY lost for whole-node OSNA analysis compared with histopathology analysis and &amp;pound;24,863 saved per QALY lost for whole-node Metasin analysis compared with histopathology analysis. The ICERs for whole-node analysis compared with histopathology analysis suggest that the intraoperative testing strategies save money but that there is a loss of approximately 0.1 QALY, compared with histopathology analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee considered the unpublished non-peer reviewed evidence for the Metasin test. The Committee acknowledged the findings of the 2 draft unpublished studies, but noted that the studies had not been peer reviewed and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. The Committee concluded that the test appeared promising but that there was too much uncertainty associated with the evidence to recommend use of the test in routine&amp;nbsp;National Health Service (NHS) practice. The Committee was encouraging of further research on this test.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee acknowledged that the model contained several assumptions that could potentially increase the uncertainty of the cost-effectiveness analysis. The Committee was of the view that, if the economic model used a more realistic cost for histopathology, it would indicate that the RD-100i OSNA system was less cost-effective than the base-case ICERs presented in the Diagnostics Assessment Report (DAR). However, given all of the uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness analyses (see section 6.13 in the original guideline document), the Committee concluded that the RD-100i OSNA system was still likely to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Sections 5 and 6 in the original guideline document for more information on cost-effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
