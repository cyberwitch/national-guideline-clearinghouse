Implications of a strong recommendation for patients are that most people in their situation would desire the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not. Implications for clinicians are that most patients should receive the recommended course of action, and adherence to this recommendation is a reasonable measure of good-quality care. With regard to policy-makers, a strong recommendation means that it can be adapted as a policy in most situations, and for funding agencies it means the intervention likely represents an appropriate allocation of resources (i.e., large net benefits relative to alternative allocation of resources).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table: Suggested Scheme for Calcium Supplementation in Pregnant Women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; summary=&quot;Table: Suggested Scheme for Calcium Supplementation in Pregnant Women&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Dosage&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;1.5&amp;ndash;2.0 g elemental calcium/day&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Frequency&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Daily, with the total daily dosage divided into three doses (preferably taken at mealtimes)&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Duration&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;From 20 weeks' gestation until the end of pregnancy&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Target group&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;All pregnant women, particularly those at higher risk of gestational hypertension&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Settings&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Areas with low calcium intake&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;1 g of elemental calcium equals 2.5 g of calcium carbonate or 4 g of calcium citrate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;Women are regarded as being at high risk of developing hypertension and pre-eclampsia if they have one or more of the following risk factors: obesity, previous pre-eclampsia, diabetes, chronic hypertension, renal disease, autoimmune disease, nulliparity, advanced maternal age, adolescent pregnancy and conditions leading to hyperplacentation and large placentas (e.g., twin pregnancy). This is not an exhaustive list, but can be adapted/complemented based on the local epidemiology of pre-eclampsia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remarks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Assessment of the risk of developing gestational hypertensive disorders is to be conducted by a clinician. The clinical management of women with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia requires consideration of other evidence-informed interventions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Implementation of this recommendation requires close monitoring of women's total daily calcium intake (diet, supplements and antacids). The overall intake of calcium per day should not exceed the locally established upper tolerable limit. In the absence of such reference standards, an upper limit of calcium intake of 3 g/day can be used. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The mechanisms through which calcium reduces the risk of gestational hypertension need further elucidation. Available evidence supports the theory that calcium supplementation may reduce the risk of developing pre-eclampsia by filling a dietary gap in calcium intake. In populations where consumption of calcium on average meets the recommended dietary calcium intake, either through calcium-rich foods or fortified staple foods, calcium supplementation is not encouraged as it may not improve the outcomes related to pre-eclampsia and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy but might increase the risk of adverse effects. Although antacids are a rich source of calcium, they are not part of the diet and their use should be limited to the treatment of heartburn or indigestion. The calcium content of any other vitamin and mineral supplements that are also being taken should be considered when recommending calcium supplementation, to reduce the risk of hypercalcaemia. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Determination of the dietary calcium intake of an individual woman is a complex task. The target group for this recommendation comprises populations with observed low dietary calcium intake or those living in geographical areas where calcium-rich foods are not commonly available or consumed. Calcium intake at population level can be estimated through various means including dietary surveys using 24-hour recalls, food frequency questionnaires or food weighing, as well as through secondary data estimates derived from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food balance sheets or household consumption and expenditure surveys. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Healthy dietary practices to promote adequate calcium intake through local calcium-rich foods should be encouraged in the general population, including pregnant women. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Interaction between iron supplements and calcium supplements may occur, although the consequences of prolonged calcium supplementation for iron status among different age groups are still unclear. Therefore, the two nutrients should preferably be administered several hours apart (i.e., iron may be consumed between meals) rather than concomitantly. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Selection of the most appropriate delivery platform should be context specific, with the aim of reaching the most vulnerable populations and ensuring a timely and continuous supply of supplements. Calcium supplementation could be delivered by lay health workers along with targeted monitoring and evaluation. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Calcium supplements are available as tablets or capsules. Tablets (soluble tablets, effervescent tablets, chewable tablets for use in the mouth and modified-release tablets) are solid dosage forms containing one or more active ingredients. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With strong recommendations, the guideline communicates the message that the desirable effects of adherence to the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects. This means that in most situations the recommendation can be adopted as policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditional Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are made when there is greater uncertainty about the four factors above or if local adaptation has to account for a greater variety in values and preferences, or when resource use makes the intervention suitable for some, but not for other locations. This means that there is a need for substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before this recommendation can be adopted as policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guideline was developed in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) evidence-informed guideline development procedures, as outlined in the WHO handbook for guideline development (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope of the Guideline, Evidence Appraisal and Decision-making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An initial set of questions (and the components of the questions) to be addressed in the guideline was the critical starting point for formulating the recommendation. The questions were drafted by technical staff at the Evidence and Programme Guidance Unit, Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, based on policy and programme guidance needs of Member States and their partners. The population, intervention, control, outcomes (PICO) format was used (see Annex 7 in the original guideline document). The questions were discussed and reviewed by the WHO Steering Committee for Nutrition Guidelines Development, and feedback was received from four stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Nutrition Guidance Advisory Group meeting was held on 14&amp;ndash;16 March 2011 in Geneva, Switzerland, to finalize the scope of the questions and rank the critical outcomes and populations of interest for the recommendation on calcium supplementation in pregnant women for the improvement of maternal and neonatal outcomes. The Nutrition Guidance Advisory Group&amp;ndash;Micronutrients Subgroup discussed the relevance of the questions and modified them as needed. The guideline group scored the relative importance of each outcome from 1 to 9 (where 7&amp;ndash;9 indicated that the outcome was critical for a decision, 4&amp;ndash;6 indicated that it was important and 1&amp;ndash;3 indicated that it was not important). The final key questions on this intervention, along with the outcomes that were identified as critical for decision-making, are listed in PICO format in Annex 7 in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two systematic reviews were used to summarize and appraise the evidence using the Cochrane methodology for randomized controlled trials* (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). WHO staff prepared evidence summaries according to the &lt;em&gt;Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation&lt;/em&gt; (GRADE) approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence. GRADE considers: the study design; the limitations of the studies in terms of their conduct and analysis; the consistency of the results across the available studies; the directness (or applicability and external validity) of the evidence with respect to the populations, interventions and settings where the proposed intervention may be used; and the precision of the summary estimate of the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both the systematic reviews and the GRADE evidence profiles for each of the critical outcomes were used for drafting this guideline. The draft recommendation was discussed by the WHO Steering Committee for Nutrition Guidelines Development and at a second consultation with the Nutrition Guidance Advisory Group, held on 7&amp;ndash;9 November 2011 in Washington DC, United States of America. At the second consultation, the guideline development group members independently voted on the strength of the recommendation, taking into account: (i) the desirable and undesirable effects of the intervention; (ii) the quality of the available evidence; (iii) values and preferences related to the intervention in different settings; and (iv) the cost of options available to health-care workers in different settings (see Annex 3 in the original guideline document). It was noted how they balanced the decisions for each of the four domains. The voting results and the summary of the considerations for establishing the strength of the recommendation were disclosed before the end of the meeting and further discussed as needed. Consensus was defined as agreement by simple majority of the guideline group members. WHO staff present at the meeting as well as other external technical experts involved in the collection and grading of the evidence were not allowed to vote. There were no strong disagreements among the guideline group members.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;*The detailed methods used in each systematic review, as well as their search dates, are published and available (open access) via The Cochrane Library. As part of the Cochrane pre-publication editorial process, this review was commented on by external peers (an editor, and two referees external to the editorial team) and the group's statistical adviser (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cochrane.org/cochrane-reviews&quot; title=&quot;Cochrane Web site&quot;&gt;http://www.cochrane.org/cochrane-reviews&lt;/a&gt;).

Prior to implementation, a public health programme that includes the provision of calcium supplements to pregnant women should have well-defined objectives that take into account available resources, existing policies, suitable delivery platforms and suppliers, communication channels, and potential stakeholders. Ideally, calcium supplementation should be implemented as part of an integrated programme for antenatal care and preceded by an assessment of the calcium intake at population level. The latter can be estimated through various means including dietary surveys using 24-hour recalls, food frequency questionnaires or food weighing, as well as through secondary data estimates derived from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food balance sheets or household consumption and expenditure surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that World Health Organization (WHO) global guidelines and other evidence-informed recommendations for nutrition interventions are better implemented in low and middle-income countries, the Department of Nutrition for Health and Development works with the WHO Evidence-Informed Policy Network (EVIPNet) programme. EVIPNet promotes partnerships at country level between policy-makers, researchers and civil society to facilitate policy development and implementation through use of the best available evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring and Evaluation of Guideline Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A plan for monitoring and evaluation with appropriate indicators is encouraged at all stages. The impact of this guideline can be evaluated within countries (i.e., monitoring and evaluation of the programmes implemented at national or regional scale) and across countries (i.e., the adoption and adaptation of the guideline globally). The WHO Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, Evidence and Programme Guidance Unit, jointly with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) International Micronutrient Malnutrition Prevention and Control (IMMPaCt) programme, and with input from international partners, has developed a generic logic model for micronutrient interventions in public health to depict the plausible relationships between inputs and expected MDGs by applying the micronutrient programme evaluation theory. Member States can adjust the model and use it in combination with appropriate indicators, for designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating the successful escalation of nutrition actions in public health programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For evaluation at the global level, the WHO Department of Nutrition for Health and Development has developed a centralized platform for sharing information on nutrition actions in public health practice implemented around the world. By sharing programmatic details, specific country adaptations and lessons learnt, this platform will provide examples of how guidelines are being translated into nutrition actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
