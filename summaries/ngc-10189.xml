In September 2010, NICE released a partial review and update to NICE TA75 in order to address extensions to the marketing authorisations for peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b. Those recommendations are designated below with the label &lt;strong&gt;2010 addendum&lt;/strong&gt;. In November 2013, NICE released an addendum to NICE TA106 and TA200 to address use of peginterferon and ribavirin in children. A new and updated recommendation has been designated below with the label &lt;strong&gt;2013 addendum&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Combination therapy, comprising peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin or peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, is recommended, within the licensed indications of these drugs, for the treatment of mild chronic hepatitis C. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Monotherapy with peginterferon alfa-2a or peginterferon alfa-2b is recommended, within the licensed indications of these drugs, for the treatment of mild chronic hepatitis C for people who are unable to tolerate ribavirin, or for whom ribavirin is contraindicated. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The decision on whether a person with mild chronic hepatitis C should be treated immediately or should wait until the disease has reached a moderate stage (&quot;watchful waiting&quot;) should be made by the person after fully informed consultation with the responsible clinician. The decision to treat need not depend on a liver biopsy to determine the stage of the disease if treatment is initiated immediately. However, a biopsy may be recommended by the clinician for other reasons or if a strategy of watchful waiting is chosen. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010 addendum&lt;/strong&gt;: Combination therapy with peginterferon alfa (2a or 2b) and ribavirin is recommended as a treatment option for adults with chronic hepatitis C:&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Who have been treated previously with peginterferon alfa (2a or 2b) and ribavirin in combination, or with peginterferon alfa monotherapy, and whose condition either did not respond to treatment or responded initially to treatment but subsequently relapsed &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010 addendum&lt;/strong&gt;: Shortened courses of combination therapy with peginterferon alfa (2a or 2b) and ribavirin are recommended for the treatment of adults with chronic hepatitis C who:&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Have a rapid virological response to treatment at week 4 that is identified by a highly sensitive test &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;Are considered suitable for a shortened course of treatment. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010 addendum&lt;/strong&gt;: When deciding on the duration of combination therapy, clinicians should take into account the licensed indication of the chosen drug (peginterferon alfa-2a or peginterferon alfa-2b), the genotype of the hepatitis C virus, the viral load at the start of treatment and the response to treatment (as indicated by the viral load). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;There is insufficient evidence to recommend combination therapy or monotherapy with peginterferon alfa for people with mild chronic hepatitis C who have had a liver transplant. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013 addendum&lt;/strong&gt;: Peginterferon alfa in combination with ribavirin is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating chronic hepatitis C in children and young people. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform systematic literature reviews on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare assessment reports. The assessment reports for this technology appraisal were prepared by the Southampton Health Technology Assessment Centre (SHTAC).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;2006 Guideline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Complete methodology on the systematic literature review for NICE technology appraisal guidance 106 (TA106) 'Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for the treatment of mild chronic hepatitis C' can be found in the 2005 Assessment Report prepared by SHTAC (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;2010 Addendum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In September 2010, NICE released a partial review and update to the NICE technology appraisal guidance 75 (TA75) and NICE TA106 in order to address extensions to the marketing authorisations for peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b. Complete methodology on the systematic literature review for the 2010 addendum can be found in the 2009 Assessment Report prepared by SHTAC (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;2013 Addendum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current guidance partially updates NICE TA106 'Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for the treatment of mild chronic hepatitis C' and NICE TA75 'Interferon alfa (pegylated and non-pegylated) and ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C'&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Complete methodology on the systematic literature review for the 2013 addendum can be found in the 2013 Assessment Report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identification of Studies for the Systematic Reviews of Clinical and Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A search strategy was developed and refined by an experienced information specialist to identify all relevant studies investigating the two forms of peginterferon alfa with ribavirin in children and young people with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). Separate searches were conducted to identify studies of clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, resource use/costs, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and epidemiology. The search strategies are provided in Appendix 2 of the 2013 assessment report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field). Searches for clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness literature were undertaken from database inception to November 2012. The searches were not restricted by study design or language. The strategies were applied to the following databases:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) (University of York) databases: Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Medline (Ovid) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;EMBASE (Ovid) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;PreMedline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations (Ovid) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Web of Science with Conference Proceedings: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI) (ISI Web of Knowledge) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Biosis Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bibliographies of retrieved papers were screened for relevant studies. The manufacturers' submissions (MS) to NICE were assessed for any additional studies. Members of the advisory group who were contacted for advice and peer review were also asked to identify any additional published and unpublished references. All search results were downloaded into a Reference Manager database (Thomson Reuters, New York, USA).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other websites, including key hepatitis C websites and symposia, were also searched for completed or ongoing studies. These included: Clinical Trials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio (UKCRN), Health Protection Agency (HPA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of Health (DoH), Zetoc, Scirus, Hepatitis C Trust, World Hepatitis Alliance, British Association for Study of the Liver (BASL), European Association for Study of the Liver (EASL), British Liver Trust, British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), Foundation for Liver Research, American Association for Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), Hepatitis C Scotland, Welsh Association for Gastroenterology and Endoscopy (WAGE), British Association for Liver Disease Nursing Forum (BASLNF), HIVandHepatitis.com, Cambridge Liver Symposium and the British Viral&amp;nbsp;Hepatitis Group (BVHG).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclusion Process&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each reference identified by the clinical effectiveness search strategy was screened for potential eligibility on the basis of title, and abstract (where available), using the inclusion criteria detailed below. Screening was carried out independently by two reviewers and the full texts of potentially relevant studies were obtained for further assessment. Screening of full papers was performed in a two-stage process. Firstly, papers were screened according to the inclusion criteria for population, intervention and outcomes using an inclusion coding sheet (see Appendix 3 of the 2013 assessment report [see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field]). Papers that fulfilled these inclusion criteria were then screened on the basis of study design according to the hierarchy outlined in the 'Study design' section below. It was not anticipated that there would be much randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence in this population group and the two-stage process allowed an assessment of the different levels of evidence available whilst ensuring that all relevant studies were captured. Full papers were screened by one reviewer and checked by a second. At each stage, any disagreement between reviewers was resolved by discussion or involvement of a third reviewer where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Titles and abstracts identified by the cost-effectiveness search strategy were assessed for potential eligibility by two reviewers independently. Studies were only considered for inclusion if they reported the results of full economic evaluations (details below). Full papers of potentially relevant studies were retrieved and assessed for inclusion by two reviewers independently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following criteria are those stipulated in the final scope issued by NICE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Population&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Children and young people aged 3 to 17 years (peginterferon alfa-2b), or 5 to 17 years (peginterferon alfa-2a), with chronic hepatitis C, without liver decompensation and who are positive for HCV RNA.

If no RCTs of relevance were identified, non-randomised controlled trials were considered for inclusion. Studies without a control group were only considered for inclusion in the absence of any controlled studies. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Studies published in the last five years (i.e., since 2007) as abstracts or conference presentations were only included if sufficient details were presented to allow an appraisal of the methodology and an assessment of results to be undertaken. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;For the systematic review of cost-effectiveness, studies were only included if they reported the results of full economic evaluations (cost-utility analyses, cost-effectiveness analyses [reporting cost per life year gained], cost-benefit analyses or cost-consequence analyses). &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Systematic reviews were only used as a source of references. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Case series, case studies, narrative reviews, editorials and opinions were not included. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Only studies published in the English language were included. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to appendices 1, 2, and 3 of the 2013 assessment report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for detailed information on search strategies for the 2013 addendum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Complete methodology on the systematic literature review for the 2010 addendum can be found in the 2009 Assessment Report prepared by SHTAC (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;2013 Addendum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current guidance partially updates NICE TA106 'Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for the treatment of mild chronic hepatitis C' and NICE TA75 'Interferon alfa (pegylated and non-pegylated) and ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C'.

Extracted data were checked by a second reviewer with any discrepancies resolved by discussion or recourse to a third reviewer when necessary. Full data extraction forms of all the included studies can be found in Appendices 4 and 8 of the 2013 Assessment Report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critical Appraisal Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the clinical effectiveness studies was assessed according to criteria based on those used by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD, University of York). The quality of the included economic evaluations was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist based upon those proposed by Drummond and colleagues and Philips and colleagues. Quality criteria of the included studies were assessed by one reviewer, and checked for agreement by a second reviewer. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus or consultation with a third reviewer if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods of Data Synthesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clinical effectiveness data were synthesised through a narrative review with tabulation of the results of included studies. Full data extraction forms of all the included studies can be found in Appendix 4 of the 2013 Assessment Report. It was not considered appropriate to combine the studies in a meta-analysis primarily due to study design and poor study quality, with the related uncertainties. There was also some heterogeneity between studies in patient characteristics (e.g., mode of hepatitis C virus [HCV] transmission, genotype mix, treatment history), all of which can have a potential impact on the virological response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The economic analysis comprises a systematic review of the literature on the cost-effectiveness of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin treatment; a systematic review of studies of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with chronic HCV; a review of the drug manufacturers' submissions to NICE; and an independent economic model and cost-effectiveness evaluation (the SHTAC model).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See section 5 of the 2013 Assessment Report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for additional information on cost-effectiveness analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE website. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Three of these studies compared interferon combination therapy with no treatment rather than with delayed treatment. These three studies showed that interferon combination therapy was cost-effective when compared with standard care (all estimated mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] were less than &amp;pound;10,000 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). Two studies compared early treatment with peginterferon alfa combination therapy with delayed treatment. They showed that, for genotypes 2 and 3, early treatment is apparently cost-effective when compared with delayed treatment, but the case for early treatment for genotype 1 is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See section 4.2 in the original 2006 guideline document (see the &quot;Guideline Availability&quot; field) for a detailed discussion of the cost-effectiveness evidence and interpretation, including information about non-1 genotype hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotype 1 HCV, monotherapy: all genotypes, and the sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;2010 Addendum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that adopting a shortened duration of treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for people with HCV genotype 1 is associated with fewer QALYs, but also with lower treatment costs, resulting in ICERs ranging from &amp;pound;34,000 to &amp;pound;65,000 of savings per QALY lost. For people with genotypes 2 and 3, a shortened treatment course with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin dominates the standard treatment duration. Similarly, for people with HCV genotype 1, a shortened duration of treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin dominates the standard treatment duration. The results submitted by the manufacturers and those reported by the Assessment Group also indicate that treatment with peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin for people who are eligible for re-treatment following previous non-response or relapse of their condition is associated with QALY gains and an increase in costs. If an early stopping rule was applied at 12 weeks, re-treatment with peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin was associated with ICERs below &amp;pound;10,000 per QALY gained for people with HCV genotypes 1 and 4. For people with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, re-treatment was associated with ICERs below &amp;pound;2294 per QALY gained or dominated best supportive care. For people co-infected with HCV and HIV who were treated with peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin, either all ICERs were below &amp;pound;12,000 per QALY gained or treatment dominated best supportive care.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See section 4.2 in the 2010 addendum document (see the &quot;Guideline Availability&quot; field) for a detailed description of cost-effectiveness data, including information about manufacturers' models and the Assessment Group's model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;2013 Addendum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Appraisal Committee's Key Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Availability and Nature of Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee considered the Assessment Group's and the 2 manufacturer's economic models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee questioned the manufacturers' decision to rely on previous utility values without validating them and the Assessment Group's decision for using Swedish and Canadian health-related quality-of-life data, considering the Committee's preference for utility values derived from UK population studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee noted that none of the models included disutility associated with growth impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although each of the models presented incorporated different stopping rules, the Committee would have expected the stopping rules to be consistent with clinical practice and the marketing authorisation of both products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous sustained virological response without treatment was not included in the manufacturers' or the Assessment Group's base-case, although they considered it in sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the Committee was certain that addressing the shortcomings identified in the economic evaluations would not alter its conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incorporation of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Utility values used in the manufacturers' models were based on previous technology appraisals in adults and the values had not been updated, revalidated or presented to the Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-Related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Successful treatment could reduce HCV transmission rates to uninfected people in the UK population and if this benefit was included in the model, the results would likely be even more favourable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin might, in part, alleviate a mother's burden of psychological guilt of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C and remove concerns about horizontal transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost-Effective?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-Effectiveness?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the comparison of peginterferon alfa-2a with peginterferon alfa-2b, the key drivers of cost-effectiveness were the estimates of clinical effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most Likely Cost-Effectiveness Estimate (given as an ICER)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer's and Assessment Group's base-case results showed that peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b (both plus ribavirin) dominated best supportive care in all genotypes, except Roche's cost-effectiveness results for children and young people with HCV genotype 1, 4 or 5, which resulted in an ICER of &amp;pound;3900 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
