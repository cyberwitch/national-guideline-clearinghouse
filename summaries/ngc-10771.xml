      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the Aberdeen Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Group (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of the Methods of Review(s)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Searches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The company states that literature searches were undertaken in October 2013 and updated in August 2014. An appropriate range of databases were searched: MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, PubMed and CENTRAL as well as the major clinical trials registers and relevant conference proceedings for the last six years. Full details of the search strategies are included in the company's submission (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) and are reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The searches were designed to identify all trials for diabetic retinal disease without specifying aflibercept or any of the relevant comparators. As such the search was very broad and therefore would be expected to be highly sensitive. The search strategies followed the same structure: a combination of the search facets &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Mellitus&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Macular Degeneration&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Macular Oedema&lt;/em&gt; and then addition of the &lt;em&gt;Diabetic Retinopathy&lt;/em&gt; facet using the Boolean operator OR. Appropriate randomised controlled trial (RCT) filters were used in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Specific additional searches for adverse events were not undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is some concern, however, that only &quot;oedema&quot; was used throughout the searches and not the most commonly used spelling &quot;edema&quot;. In MEDLINE, the correct MeSH is &quot;Macular Edema&quot;/. However, the company's search used &quot;Macular Oedema&quot;. This term returned 0 hits when replicated by the ERG. Nevertheless, the submission indicates that 4542 hits were returned in the initial MEDLINE search and it is unclear how this was achieved. In EMBASE the incorrect term was again used but was automatically mapped to the correct term. This error was also applied to the text word searching throughout the searches in all databases and conference abstract searches. This error could have affected the sensitivity of the search. However, apart for this error, a comprehensive list of search terms and combinations were used and, to some extent, may have compensated for this omission.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclusion Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion criteria used in the company's systematic review of clinical effectiveness are presented in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Table.

optic disc area; area of lesion; size of leakage; greatest linear dimension; change in total lesion size) seem to relate to other condition (exudative age-related macular degeneration [AMD]) and not to diabetic macular oedema (DMO). Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;retinal degradation&lt;/em&gt;, in the list of adverse events, does not describe a retinal disease or complication and it is a term not commonly used in current ophthalmic clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identified Studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The company's submission included two RCTs, VISTA and VIVID, comparing aflibercept (2 mg every 4 weeks or every 8 weeks after five initial monthly doses) versus focal laser photocoagulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ERG Comment on Company's Review of Cost-effectiveness Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives of the Cost-effectiveness Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review was carried out by the company to identify relevant cost-effectiveness studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The company states in the submission that literature searches for cost-effectiveness studies were undertaken in October 2013 and subsequently updated in August 2014. An appropriate range of databases were searched: MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, EconLIT and National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) as well as relevant conference proceedings for the last six years. Full details of the search strategies are included in the company's submission and are reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategies followed the same structure as for the clinical effectiveness searches and replace the RCTs filters with appropriate cost-effectiveness filters. Once again, however, the term 'edema' was not used and this omission had the potential to impact on the sensitivity of the search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regard to quality of life data, the company conducted literature searches in February 2014. An appropriate range of databases were searched: MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, EconLIT and NHS EED. Full details of the search strategies are included in the company's submission and are reproducible. The search strategies followed the same structure as for previous searches with the inclusion of appropriate quality of life/utilities filters. In addition specific utilities for adverse events and blindness were sought. For all searches, both 'oedema' and 'edema' had been used correctly. These searches were judged by the ERG to be adequate and comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria of the Cost-effectiveness Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only full-published economic evaluations were eligible, including studies based on models or performed alongside clinical trials. General cost of illness, economic burden, sot-minimisation and budget impact studies were not considered for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Studies Included in the Cost-effectiveness Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The systematic literature review identified 10 studies directly related to the decision problem. The company submission provides an overview of these ten studies. The TA274 ranibizumab for diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is perhaps the most immediately relevant of all identified studies. The submission draws a number of values from this. The Haig et al. study, which models the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab for DMO in the Canadian setting, is also particularly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform an assessment of the manufacturer's submission on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an Evidence Review Group (ERG) report. The ERG report for this technology appraisal was prepared by the Aberdeen Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Group (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of the Methods of Review(s)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critique of Data Extraction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The company used the methods recommended by the German Institute for Quality and Efficacy in Health Care (IQWiG), the Cochrane Collaboration and the University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) to assess current evidence. The methods described in these publications are, in general, considered appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Title/abstract screening, full-text screening, and quality assessment were all carried out by two independent reviewers with a third reviewer acting as arbitrator, where necessary. Data extraction was carried out by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. These procedures are all considered appropriate. The information and data extracted from the included studies are detailed in the company's submission and considered appropriate, even though it is not clear whether they were specified &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quality Assessment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The company adopted the criteria specified by the CRD for the assessment of the risk of bias in the VISTA and VIVID randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The criteria, which involve assessment of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias, are considered appropriate by the ERG.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The VISTA and VIVID RCTs were based on the same methodology, the quality of which is considered adequate. In particular, the randomisation process is appropriate and has proved to be successful (i.e., baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced across the intervention groups). The company maintain that concealment was adequate based upon randomisation being via&amp;nbsp;interactive voice response system/interactive web response system (IVRS/IWRS) and the study being double masked. This information is considered insufficient to assess whether concealment of treatment allocation was performed adequately. Study personnel and participants were masked throughout the trials, with the exception of the unmasked personnel who administered the study drug but took no other part in the study. The ERG considers this masking strategy appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ERG conducted a quality assessment of the methods used by the company for the systematic review of clinical evidence using the CRD criteria. Results are presented in Table 6 of the ERG report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 4.1.6 in the ERG report for more information about quality assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of Trials of the Technology of Interest, Their Analysis and Interpretation (and Any Standard Meta-analyses of These)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meta-analysis of VIVID and VISTA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The submission includes standard meta-analyses of the results of the VISTA and VIVID trials for a number of relevant outcomes. The results are presented initially in tabular format (in the company's submission) using both fixed and random effects models. Some of these results are also presented as forest plots within the indirect comparison section of company submission. The meta-analysis comparisons are made exclusively between aflibercept 2Q8 regimen and laser. This choice is justified by the fact that aflibercept 2 mg intravitreal every 8 weeks (2Q8) is the licensed aflibercept dose in the UK and that approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critique of Submitted Evidence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is worth pointing out that main entry criterion for VIVID and VISTA was a central retinal thickness (CRT) in the 1 mm central retina, as assessed by ocular coherence tomography (OCT) (not determined whether spectral domain or time domain OCT). Thus, at entry, patients may or may not have fulfilled the standard definition of clinically significant macular oedema (CSMO). CSMO was, however, used as re-treatment criterion for laser photocoagulation therapy. Thus, one could argue that the initial laser treatment was not given based on the presence of CSMO while the re-treatments were; the rationale for this is unclear to the ERG. It is not specified either whether fluorescein angiography was obtained prior to laser treatment to guide laser (as recommended by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS]).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critique of the Indirect Comparison and/or Multiple Treatment Comparison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critique of Network Meta-analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The company provided a network meta-analysis for both fixed and random effects. Although the company provided the WINBUGS codes for the model and the source data, they did not provide information on the initial values used, or the process of running the model. The ERG were able to determine from the model results provided in the submission's Appendices that the company had used a burn-in of 20, 000 iterations, followed by 20,000 iterations, which acted as updates for the model. However, it was not clear if this was 20,000 consecutive updates or say 100,000 using a thinning parameter of five. Models can be sensitive to the initial values and because the company did not provide their initial values or full details on the iterative process, in some cases, the ERG were unable to replicate the results. The ERG independently extracted source data from the references and matched them with those provided by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Section 4 and Tables 4 to 19 in the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for additional information on clinical effectiveness analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary and Critique of Company's Submitted Economic Evaluation by the ERG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model Structure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; Markov model with a monthly cycle was developed by the company. This is a bilateral vision model with each eye being in one of eight possible health states which are in the main 10 ETDRS letters wide. This results in a total of 64 possible vision states plus the additional absorbing health state of death. The health states for each eye are based upon the ETDRS letter ranges (see Table 22 of the ERG report).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Patients enter the model having at least one eye being treated for diabetic macular oedema (DMO). Of these patients 46.5% are assumed to be bilateral at baseline. An additional 10% of the remainder develop fellow eye DMO involvement at the start of years 2, 3, 4 and 5. It is assumed that 50% of the fellow eyes with DMO at baseline will be treated at baseline, and that 50% of incident fellow eye DMO will be treated at incidence. The other 50% of fellow eyes with DMO are assumed not to be treated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For eyes that are treated there is an initial efficacy phase of one year followed by a maintenance phase of 4 years. Treatments are associated with a treatment specific discontinuation rate during the first 5 years of treatment. After 5 years all treatment stops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The clinical effectiveness estimates for the efficacy phase are based upon applying the relative risks of the network meta-analysis to the rates of improving and worsening by at least two health states and by one health state in the pooled VIVID/VISTA laser arm. During the four year maintenance phase treatment is assumed to continue. Eyes that remain on treatment retain stable vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When treatment stops, due to either discontinuation or the end of the maintenance phase, the eye is subject to a monthly 1.15% probability of deteriorating by one health state. This is based upon the 3.5% quarterly rate of deterioration used within the single technology appraisal (STA) of ranibizumab for DMO.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Non-DMO eyes are subject to a monthly 0.17% probability of deteriorating by one health state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refer to Sections 5 and 6 in the ERG report (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field) for additional information on cost-effectiveness analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee. This includes health professionals working in the NHS and people who are familiar with the issues affecting patients and carers. Although the Appraisal Committee seeks the views of organisations representing health professionals, patients, carers, manufacturers and government, its advice is independent of any vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The Committee concluded that the company model was acceptable for assessing the cost-effectiveness of aflibercept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncertainties Around and Plausibility of Assumptions and Inputs in the Economic Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee heard from the Evidence Review Group (ERG) that the annual cost of blindness had been applied monthly and had not been discounted in the company's model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee acknowledged that the summary of product characteristics for aflibercept and ranibizumab states a reduced dosing interval after the first 12 months, and agreed that there is uncertainty around the average number of aflibercept injections that a person would receive after the first 12 months. Given that there is no robust clinical data for estimating the average number of aflibercept injections in year 2, the Committee concluded that the economic modelling of treatment should be based on trial data, and that a sensitivity analysis that included an equalisation of the number of injections of aflibercept and ranibizumab in year 2 was an acceptable basis for its decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee considered the company's rationale and the ERG's critique for increasing the cost of a laser administration from &amp;pound;139 to &amp;pound;194. The Committee concluded that it was appropriate to have an equal cost for both a laser and intravitreal injection administration and agreed to increase the cost of laser administration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporation of Health-related Quality-of-Life Benefits and Utility Values. Have Any Potential Significant and Substantial Health-related Benefits Been Identified That Were Not Included in the Economic Model, and How Have They Been Considered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ERG considered the literature-sourced values from Czoski-Murray et al. (2009) were not ideal because the values apply only to the bilateral best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), which meant that the company had to use an adjustment factor to calculate the utility values of the worse seeing eye. The Committee acknowledged the company's reason for using Czoski-Murray et al. (2009) utility values in its submission (that is, consistency with other NICE technology eye appraisals). It also acknowledged that sensitivity analyses using the utility values from Brown (1999) and Brown (2000) were included. It concluded that the Czoski-Murray et al. utility values, although not ideal, were an acceptable basis for its decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are There Specific Groups of People for Whom the Technology Is Particularly Cost Effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee heard from clinical experts that in clinical practice the choice of treatment depends on the central retinal thickness (CRT) and so it considered separately the cost effectiveness of aflibercept compared with laser in people with a CRT of less than 400 micrometres and in people with a CRT of 400 micrometres or more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are the Key Drivers of Cost-effectiveness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results of the ERG sensitivity analyses over various ranibizumab discounts showed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) up to &amp;pound;1,260,695 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (100% ranibizumab discount using the EuroQol-5 dimension [EQ-5D] generalised estimating equation analysis). The ERG noted that in these analyses the choice of quality-of-life values had the biggest effect on the ICER.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Likely Cost-effectiveness Estimate (Given as an ICER)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For aflibercept compared with ranibizumab in the whole trial population, the ICER is within the range considered to be a cost-effective use of National Health Service (NHS) resources (below &amp;pound;20,000 per QALY gained).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee then considered the revised base-case ICER for aflibercept compared with laser in the whole trial population that incorporated the Committee's preferred assumption of an increased cost of laser administration. The Committee noted that the ICER was &amp;pound;33,100 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee noted that the ICER for the less than 400 micrometres CRT subgroup was &amp;pound;49,400 per QALY gained for the comparison of aflibercept with laser. It considered the revised ICER using the increased cost of laser administration, which was &amp;pound;48,300 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Committee considered the ICERs for aflibercept compared with laser in the subgroup of people with CRT 400 micrometres or more. The ICER for people with a CRT of 400 micrometres or more was &amp;pound;22,000 per QALY gained. It considered the revised ICER by the ERG using the increased cost of laser administration, which was &amp;pound;21,400 per QALY gained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
