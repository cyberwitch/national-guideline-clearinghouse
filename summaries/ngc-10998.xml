The prescriber should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision. Informed consent should be obtained and documented. See the General Medical Council's Good practice in prescribing medicines &amp;ndash; guidance for doctors for further information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p class=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The use of PLDH (Caelyx) in combination with platinum is outside the terms of the marketing authorisation for Caelyx. Consequently the statutory funding requirement does not apply to this recommendation. NICE received a remit to appraise this combination under Regulation 5 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/259/contents/made&quot; title=&quot;UK Legislation Web site&quot;&gt;National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Constitution and Functions) and the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Functions) Regulations 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform a systematic literature review on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an assessment report. The Assessment Report for this technology appraisal was prepared by BMJ-Technology Assessment Group (BMJ TAG) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Assessment of Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods for Reviewing Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identification of Studies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The literature search for this review was designed to update and expand the systematic search carried out in Technology Appraisal 91 (TA91), which evaluated the clinical and cost-effectiveness of topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLDH), and paclitaxel. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and text terms for ovarian cancer, topotecan, PLDH, and paclitaxel were taken from the search strategy presented in TA91, and text terms added for the interventions trabectedin and gemcitabine. To ensure capture of all potentially relevant studies to inform a network meta-analysis (NMA), the decision was taken not to restrict the start date of the update search to the end date of the search (2004) reported in TA91.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the large number of studies retrieved from the scoping search, the decision was taken to implement search filters for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Filters developed and validated by Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network were used. The identified RCTs facilitated construction of three distinct networks for the outcomes of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for both the platinum-sensitive (two networks) and platinum-resistant/refractory (1 network) subgroups. In an attempt to identify a study to link the discrete networks for the platinum-sensitive subgroup, the retrieved abstracts were re-examined to consider interventions outside the scope of this review. Due to time constraints, the decision was taken not to search for non-randomised trials. Bibliographies of previous reviews and retrieved articles were searched for additional studies. Clinical trial registries were also searched to identify planned, ongoing and finalised clinical trials of interest. In addition, clinical experts were contacted with a request for information on any additional studies of which they had knowledge. The manufacturers' submissions (MSs) were assessed for unpublished data. Although the protocol stipulates that the Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings would be searched to identify relevant conference proceedings, due to time constraints this was not undertaken. However, based on the conference abstracts retrieved from the search of the pre-specified electronic databases, the Technology Assessment Group (TAG) considers it likely that the key conference abstracts have been identified. Conference abstracts that were reviewed and found not to report additional results to those presented in the relevant full publication were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Electronic databases were initially searched on 18 January 2013 and results uploaded into Reference Manager Version 11.0 and deduplicated. An update search was carried out on 23 May 2013. No papers or abstracts published after this date were included in the review. Full details of the strategies are presented in Appendix 1 of the Assessment Report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Titles and abstracts returned by the search strategy were examined independently by two researchers and screened for possible inclusion. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, or involvement of a third reviewer in cases where consensus could not be achieved. Full texts of potentially relevant studies were ordered. Full publications were assessed independently by two reviewers for inclusion or exclusion against prespecified criteria, with disagreements resolved by discussion or input from a third reviewer when consensus could not be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the review of clinical effectiveness, only RCTs were considered for inclusion in the review. Systematic reviews and non-randomised studies were excluded, as were studies that considered drugs administered as &quot;maintenance therapy&quot; following directly on from first-line therapy without evidence of disease progression. Inclusion criteria were based on the decision problem outlined in Section 3.1 of the Assessment Review (presented as a whole in the table below). No restrictions were imposed on language or date of publication. Reference lists of identified systematic reviews were used as a source of potential additional RCTs, as well as a resource to compare studies retrieved from the systematic literature search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table: Inclusion Criteria (Based on the Decision Problem) for Studies Evaluating Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;

The following databases were searched:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;MEDLINE (Ovid) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;EMBASE (Ovid) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Health Technology Assessment database (HTA) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;NHS Economic Evaluations Database (NHS EED) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The search strategy for MEDLINE and EMBASE combined terms capturing the interventions and comparators of interest (topotecan, PLDH, paclitaxel, trabectedin, gemcitabine, best supportive care, bevacizumab, carboplatin, cisplatin, and etoposide); the target condition (ovarian cancer); and terms to capture economic evaluations. As this MTA is in part an update of TA91, in which a systematic review was carried out (search date of April 2004) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of topotecan, PLDH, and paclitaxel, searches for these interventions were carried out with a date limit of 2004. Databases were searched from inception for gemcitabine and trabectedin. The search strategy for HTA and NHS EED combined terms for the target condition (ovarian cancer) with no further limits. Full details of the search terms are presented in Appendix 5 of the Assessment Report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to searches of the above databases the following sources of potentially relevant publications were explored:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Experts in the field were contacted with a request for details of relevant published and unpublished studies of which they may have knowledge. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The NICE Web site was searched for any recently published Technology Appraisals in ovarian cancer that had not already been identified via the database searches. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Reference lists of key identified studies were reviewed for any potentially relevant studies. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No restrictions on language or setting were applied to any of the searches. The titles and abstracts of papers identified through the searches were independently assessed for inclusion by two health economists using the criteria outlined in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table: Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for the Economic Evaluation Systematic Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; summary=&quot;Table: Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for the Economic Evaluation Systematic Review&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;thead&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Inclusion Criteria&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;th valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Exclusion Criteria&lt;/th&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/thead&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;All full economic evaluations (cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, cost-consequence or cost minimisation) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Any setting (to be as inclusive as possible) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;At least one of the interventions or comparators as per the final scope &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Abstracts with insufficient methodological details &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;li&gt;Systematic reviews &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/td&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/tr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The systematic review was updated in May 2013 whilst the report was under peer review. The search strategy remained the same as outlined above; however, results were limited from December 4th 2012 to May 21st 2013 in order to identify only additional relevant studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A total of 842 papers were identified from the December 2012 search (see Figure 14 in the Assessment Report). Of these papers, 740 were excluded on the basis of title and abstract. A total of 102 papers were therefore identified as potentially relevant and were ordered for full review. Of the 102 ordered papers, 59 were excluded following review of the full paper. For a description of the reason for exclusion of the ordered papers, see Appendix 6 of the Assessment Report. A total of 43 papers were identified as economic evaluations from the December 2012 search.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A further 91 papers were identified from the updated search in May 2013. Of these, 90 were excluded on the basis of title and abstract, with one paper identified as potentially relevant and ordered for full review. Additionally, two relevant NICE TAs were identified from the NICE Web site and were reviewed in full: TA284 and TA285.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)&lt;/strong&gt;: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned an independent academic centre to perform a systematic literature review on the technology considered in this appraisal and prepare an assessment report. The Assessment Report for this technology appraisal was prepared by BMJ-Technology Assessment Group (BMJ TAG) (see the &quot;Availability of Companion Documents&quot; field).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Assessment of Clinical Effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods for Reviewing Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data Abstraction Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Data pertaining to study design, methodology, baseline characteristics, and clinical outcomes efficacy were extracted by two reviewers into a standardised data extraction form and validated by a second. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion when necessary. Authors of reports published as meeting abstracts only, where insufficient methodological details were reported to allow critical appraisal of study quality were contacted with a request for additional information. If no additional information was obtained, the studies were excluded. Data extraction forms for the included studies are provided in Appendix 2 of the Assessment Report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critical Appraisal Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The quality of the clinical effectiveness data was assessed by two independent reviewers and checked for agreement. The study quality was assessed according to recommendations by the National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and recorded using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods of Data Synthesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Details of results on clinical effectiveness and quality assessment for each included study are presented in structured tables and as a narrative summary. The possible effects of study quality on the clinical effectiveness data and review findings are discussed. The 16 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) identified evaluated 14 different pair-wise comparisons. Therefore, there were insufficient data for most comparisons to carry out a standard pair-wise meta-analysis. However, the Technology Assessment Group (TAG) determined that the data identified were sufficiently homogenous to investigate comparative effectiveness of interventions via a network meta-analysis (NMA). The methods used for the NMA followed the guidance described in the NICE Decisions Support Unit's (DSU's) Technical Support Documents (TSDs) for Evidence Synthesis. In essence, an NMA assumes that each trial included in the network could have potentially included all treatments of interest but that some of these treatments are missing completely at random (MCAR). To illustrate this further, in a simple indirect comparison of three treatments A, B and C, the trials of A versus B and of B versus C are assumed to have been potentially trials of A versus B versus C but where one arm from each trial is MCAR. In this example, an estimate of the relative treatment effect of A versus C can be inferred using treatment B as a common comparator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The TAG conducted an NMA for each network using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation in WinBUGS. The following were implemented for each analysis:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Uniform priors (also called &quot;flat&quot; priors) were used. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;All outcomes were considered independent. For example, while overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) might be correlated in advanced ovarian cancer, the degree of correlation is unlikely to be derived from summary trial estimates provided in published papers. As such, in the absence of individual patient data (IPD), the TAG took the pragmatic approach of assuming all efficacy and safety outcomes were independent. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Results for all efficacy outcomes analysed were based on 50,000 iterations after a &quot;burn in&quot; of 30,000 iterations. For safety outcomes all analyses had a &quot;burn in&quot; of 30,000 iterations, with results based on 100,000 iterations. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Summary effect estimates for OS and PFS were hazard ratios (HRs), while overall response rate (ORR) and all safety outcomes used odds ratios (ORs) as summary effect estimates. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;As a result of disparity in HRs reported in the identified trials, in terms of unadjusted HRs versus adjusted HRs, together with variation in adjustment factors, for consistency the TAG used only unadjusted HRs in the NMA. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Any results taken forward into the economic model used the posterior sampling to retain the correlation between parameter estimates caused by their joint estimation from a single dataset. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the ability of the TAG to conduct NMAs was limited by the low number of trials identified (typically only one trial per treatment comparison).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See Section 4.1.5 of the Assessment Report for constraints imposed by the limited number of available trials. See Section 4 of the Assessment Report for additional information on clinical evidence analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Cost-effectiveness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Economic Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As no single published study, or manufacturer's submission, simultaneously compared the cost-effectiveness of treatments relevant to the scope of this multiple technology appraisal (MTA), the TAG carried out an independent assessment and developed a &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; economic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Model Structure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model structure employed by the TAG, to facilitate a comparison of the cost-effectiveness of the interventions and comparators outlined for this MTA, is derived from the cohort model developed in TA91 (see Figure 25 of the Assessment Report).&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The TAG elected to use a cohort model approach rather than individual patient modelling. This approach was considered to be the most appropriate because, with the exception of platinum-free interval (PFI), there is limited evidence of the effect of individual patient characteristics/history on disease course. Furthermore, data were not available at a sufficiently disaggregated level in order to model at the individual level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To capture the full costs and benefits associated with therapies for recurrent ovarian cancer, a lifetime time horizon was considered to be appropriate. In the base case analysis this is set as 15 years, because at this time point, over 99.9% of patients within the model have died. Furthermore, as per the NICE reference case, costs and benefits are discounted at a rate of 3.5% per annum, and an NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective was considered. The time horizon and discount rates used have been varied in sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See section 5 of the Assessment Report for additional information on cost-effectiveness analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Consultee organisations include national groups representing patients and carers, the bodies representing health professionals, and the manufacturers of the technology under review. Consultees are invited to submit evidence during the appraisal and to comment on the appraisal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commentator organisations include manufacturers of the products with which the technology is being compared, the National Health Service (NHS) Quality Improvement Scotland and research groups working in the area. They can comment on the evidence and other documents but are not asked to submit evidence themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE then commissions an independent academic centre to review published evidence on the technology and prepare an 'assessment report'. Consultees and commentators are invited to comment on the report. The assessment report and the comments on it are then drawn together in a document called the evaluation report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An independent Appraisal Committee then considers the evaluation report. It holds a meeting where it hears direct, spoken evidence from nominated clinical experts, patients and carers. The Committee uses all the evidence to make its first recommendations, in a document called the 'appraisal consultation document' (ACD). NICE sends all the consultees and commentators a copy of this document and posts it on the NICE Web site. Further comments are invited from everyone taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Committee meets again it considers any comments submitted on the ACD; then it prepares its final recommendations in a document called the 'final appraisal determination' (FAD). This is submitted to NICE for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consultees have a chance to appeal against the final recommendations in the FAD. If there are no appeals, the final recommendations become the basis of the guidance that NICE issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Who Is on the Appraisal Committee?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NICE technology appraisal recommendations are prepared by an independent committee.

When a NICE technology appraisal recommends the use of a drug or treatment, or other technology, the NHS in Wales must usually provide funding and resources for it within 3 months of the guidance being published. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;When NICE recommends a treatment 'as an option', the NHS must make sure it is available within the period set out in the paragraph above. This means that, if a patient has recurrent ovarian cancer and the doctor responsible for their care thinks that paclitaxel or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLDH) is the right treatment, they should be available for use, in line with NICE's recommendations. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
