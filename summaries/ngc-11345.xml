For these 3 specific questions, the AHRQ search criteria included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), of at least 2 weeks' duration during active pollen season for all individuals 12 years and older. Systematic reviews and meta-analysis that assessed relevant treatment comparisons, reported an outcome of interest, and were of high quality were included in the search. Nonrandomized trials and comparative observational studies that were blinded and controlled for confounders were also included in the search and were considered for use in the final analysis. Individuals 12 years and older were required to have a minimum 2-year history of SAR of mild to severe degree of severity, consistent with Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guideline definitions of severity, have a positive percutaneous allergy skin test result within the year before study, and be devoid of any of the predetermined exclusion criteria, as determined by the investigators. Outcomes had to include patient-reported symptom scores and/or validated quality-of-life instruments. Although ocular symptoms are important and often included in SAR studies, there was no requirement that the included trials report ocular symptoms as an outcome measure. A description of the search strategy and criteria used by the AHRQ to update the 2012 literature search for queries 1, 2, and 3 are detailed in Appendix A, Tables 1, 2, and 3 in the original guideline document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Literature Search: Databases and Results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For both the AHRQ and Rhinitis Workgroup literature searches, the following databases were searched for RCTs, nonrandomized trials, and comparative observational studies through June 29, 2016: MEDLINE (PubMed and Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). For the AHRQ search of systematic reviews from January 1, 2010, to July 18, 2012, the following additional databases were searched: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effects and the Health Technology Assessment databases of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Articles were limited to those published in the English language. Gray literature through July 18, 2012, was sought by the AHRQ by searching FDA Web site, conference abstracts of relevant professional organizations, and the clinical trial registries of the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization. The AHRQ screened titles and abstracts to select full-text articles that were eligible for review. Trained teamed reviewers completed the review in a duplicate manner. These full-text articles were then reviewed for inclusion in the systematic review process. The AHRQ search identified 4,513 records of which 169 were eliminated because they were being duplicate articles, leaving 4,344 articles for a title and abstract screen. Subsequently, 4,059 references were excluded for not meeting predefined criteria, and 285 were selected for full-text review. These were combined with the 4 articles identified through gray literature and hand search. After removing the references that failed to meet the inclusion criteria, 59 unique trials were identified of which 13 reference articles were used to address the 3 questions in the current systematic review. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The updated Rhinitis Workgroup literature search initially cast a large net for all articles published in regard to rhinitis and treatment with the therapies under consideration. This yielded the following total number of articles: PubMed MEDLINE, 6,536 records; PubMed EMBASE, 140,379; Ovid MEDLINE, 1,316; and Cochrane Trials Registry, 220; for a total of 148,451 articles. After the search terms were combined, the number of possibly relevant references for question 1 was 56, for question 2 was 20, and for question 3 was 40. A summary of the literature search is found in in Appendix A, Tables 4, 5, and 6 in the original guideline document. The details of the literature search are available in Appendix C in the original guideline document. (MEDLINE and Cochrane database printed search with review notes.) Two workgroup members reviewed all abstracts and selected full-text articles. None of the articles met the inclusion criteria that had been established. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the extended literature search conducted in 2016 by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters' (JTFPP's) Rhinitis Workgroup did not uncover any new articles that met the inclusion criteria, based on additional selected reviews by workgroup members, including references identified in other recent rhinitis GRADE analyses, the Rhinitis Workgroup selected 3 additional articles, all pertaining to question 1, for review by the methods group. However, these studies were excluded from the final analysis because required data were incomplete because of data reporting issues (see Appendix A, Table 7 in the original guideline document for details). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

They chose local and systemic symptoms generally linked to allergic rhinitis (AR) medication (e.g., somnolence for oral antihistamines and nasal bleeding for intranasal corticosteroids [INCSs]) as outcome variables of safety. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect Size and Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often when combining data from a large number of studies, which have outcome variables that are not uniform among the trials (e.g., some score nasal symptoms scores of 0&amp;ndash;12, others of 0&amp;ndash;24), the SMD is used to determine effect size. The SMD (Hedges g) is the difference between the 2 means divided by the pooled standard deviation (SD), with a correction for small sample bias. In general, when evaluating SMD, Cohen criteria are used to interpret SMD results, in which 0.2 is considered a small effect, 0.5 a moderate, and 0.8 or higher a large effect. The methods group made a decision to combine the data for all studies that used uniformly reported outcomes, such as total nasal symptom score (TNSS). However, for studies for which outcome variables were not uniform, these studies were evaluated separately; thus, SMD was not used. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Assessment of the Included Studies: Risk of Bias Using GRADE Analysis &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An assessment of risk of bias factors (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding adequacy, completeness of data, reporting, and other potential biases) that may contribute to risk of bias was initially conducted independently by 3 reviewers (2 Children's Mercy, Kansas City, evidence-based practice scholars and J.A.B.) based on the Review Manager software criteria. One nonclinician reviewer (J.A.B.) conducted a draft evaluation on the methodologic quality of the evidence based on the GRADE criteria independently. The workgroup and ultimately the Joint Task Force reviewed these draft assessments, applied their assessments of clinical importance for each patient-important outcome, and determined an overall quality of evidence across outcomes. For studies in which there had been incomplete reporting of information that might affect bias assessment, an attempt was made to contact authors to provide additional information. On the basis of additional information received from authors (see Appendix B in the original guideline document) and the workgroup and Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters' (JTFPP's) assessment of the risk of bias using each end point, a final bias assessment was determined by the JTFPP using the modified Delphi process. The level of methodologic quality for the identified literature is summarized after each clinical question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certainty of the Body of Evidence Using GRADE Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For GRADE analysis of the certainty of the evidence, 3 areas were evaluated: inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Inconsistency: studies are reviewed in terms of populations, interventions, and outcomes for similarity, or consistency, among the compared studies. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indirectness: analysis occurs around comparisons, populations, and outcomes among intervention studies. Indirectness in comparisons occurs when one drug is compared with placebo and another drug is compared with placebo, but the researchers do not compare the first drug and the second drug in a head-to-head comparison. Indirectness in populations means that the population in which the drug was studied doe not reflect the population in which the study drug would be used. Indirectness of outcome refers to a primary or secondary outcome that does not exactly measure the intended outcome (e.g., improved quality of life related to rhinitis measured with the generic quality-of-life tool SP27 instead of the specific RQLQ) and thus is not powered for the outcome of choice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imprecision: when too few study participants were enrolled or too few events occurred in the study, imprecision is detected. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GRADE quality analysis defines the certainty of the evidence. There are 4 levels of evidence (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The GRADE system for evaluating the quality of evidence (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/app&quot; title=&quot;GRADEpro Web site&quot;&gt;http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/app&lt;/a&gt;) defines the elements that guideline writing groups need to consider when evaluating the quality of references that address a specific outcome (i.e., change in TNSS). These elements include the risk of bias, described above, as well as the article design (e.g., randomized controlled trials [RCT], inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other considerations). Articles are not individually graded for these components but are reviewed overall by the guideline writing group and assigned an overall quality rating. Although some guideline writing groups have tried to develop a point system for grading of individual articles, this is not part of the formal GRADE system and was not used in this systematic review. The methods group used by the JTFPP designed a rating of individual references to assist them in their analysis, focusing on the lowest-quality grade assigned to any individual reference as the grade for all of the references used to answer any single question (see Appendix B in the original guideline document). However, the JTFPP chose to follow the GRADE handbook and reviewed all articles together to determine the overall quality of the articles for each outcome. Each JTFPP member individually determined the quality rating and using the Delphi method, the JTFPP decided the overall quality assessment for each outcome of interest. This difference in approach to the quality assessment is reflected in the discussion within the Clinical Statement Profile for each of the 3 questions. As the final step, the JTFPP rated each outcome across all studies (i.e., for a body of evidence) followed by determining an overall quality of evidence across outcomes, again using the Delphi method. The separate quality assessment tables for each of the 3 questions are included within this document. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

The workgroup first developed a list of clinical questions regarding the use of single or combination medications for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR), considering relative efficacy, possible additional efficacy by combining medications, costs, adverse effects, and other related outcomes. The top 3 questions that best addressed relevant and controversial issues were selected for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) analysis and are detailed in the Guideline Update Objective section of the original guideline document. These 3 questions were also part of the Agency for Healthcare Research (AHRQ) 2013 systematic review. The entire Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) of the AAAAI and ACAAI reviewed and approved these questions before starting the literature search. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRADE: From Quality of Evidence (Bias, Certainty) to Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the quality of evidence is evaluated, the GRADE analysis continues to take into account 3 other factors to finally recommend or suggest in favor or against a certain treatment or action: safety of the intervention, cost, and patient's preference. As such, the GRADE analysis is not only a system focused on grading the level of evidence but also a much more complete system aimed at formulating recommendations, as its acronym indicates. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the development of this practice parameter, the workgroup used the GRADE approach. In formulating the replies to the 3 key questions, they took into account the quality of evidence for treatment efficacy, combining this with patients' safety, achieving adherence, and cost. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Individual subgroups drafted the recommendations and justifications based on the GRADE analysis. Subsequently, all recommendations were reviewed by the workgroup and JTFPP. Both groups were provided the opportunity to comment, propose changes, and approve or disapprove each statement. Consensus was sought and reached for each recommendation's direction and strength. Actual or potential conflicts of interest were disclosed semiannually, and transparency of discussion was maintained. External peer review was through appointed official reviewers and membership at large of the AAAAI and the ACAAI. All comments were discussed by the JTFPP, and revisions made when the workgroup and JTFPP believed this to be appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reaching Workgroup Consensus on Statements and Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The workgroup used a modified Delphi process for the determination of the strength of the recommendation and the statement profile for each question. The Delphi method is a structured, interactive, decision-making process used by a panel of experts to arrive at a consensus when there are differing views and perspectives. For any statement or conclusion for which there was a difference of opinion, a modified Delphi method was used. Workgroup members provided anonymous answers via email to the JTFPP administrative director to the questions being considered. The administrative director provided via teleconference an anonymous summary of the experts' answers and reasons they provided for their responses. The workgroup members discussed all the answers and then were encouraged to modify their answers on the next round(s) of email voting and teleconferences until a consensus was reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

After long-term use in susceptible populations, cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, and glaucoma have been reported, especially when combined with inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Although it is beyond the scope of this review, product labeling recommends that the growth of pediatric patients receiving INCSs should be routinely monitored. The package inserts for all INCSs also recommend monitoring for intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;For montelukast, headache is the most common adverse effect and is reported more frequently than placebo in controlled trials. There are postmarketing reports with montelukast of rare neuropsychiatric events (e.g., aggression, depression, suicidal thinking, behavioral changes, dream abnormalities), which appear consistent with a drug-induced effect. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The addition of an intranasal antihistamines (INAH) to an INCS increases the potential for harm based on the risk of an adverse effect. Adverse effects include sedation and/or unpleasant taste from INAHs beyond potential nosebleeds from INCSs. Using a single intranasal device that contains 2 medications increases the cost of therapy for most patients.

Because this document incorporated the efforts of many participants, no single individual, including members serving on the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP), are authorized to provide an official AAAAI or ACAAI interpretation of these practice parameters. Any request for information or interpretation of this practice parameter by the AAAAI or ACAAI should be directed to the executive offices of the AAAAI and the ACAAI. These parameters are not designed for use by the pharmaceutical industry in drug development or promotion. The JTFPP understands that the cost of diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents is an important concern that may appropriately influence the workup and treatment chosen for a given patient. The JTFPP recognizes that the emphasis of our primary recommendations regarding a medication may vary, for example, depending on third-party payer issues and product patent expiration dates. However, because a given test or agent's cost is so widely variable, and there is a paucity of pharmacoeconomic data, the JTFPP generally does not consider cost when formulating practice parameter recommendations. In extraordinary circumstances, when the cost benefit of an intervention is prohibitive as supported by pharmacoeconomic data, commentary may be provided. These parameters are not designed for use by pharmaceutical companies in drug promotion. The JTFPP is committed to ensuring that the Practice Parameters are based on the best scientific evidence that is free of commercial bias. To this end, the parameter development process includes multiple layers of rigorous review. These layers include the work group convened to draft the parameter, the task force reviewers, and peer review by members of each sponsoring society. Although the JTFPP has the final responsibility for the content of the documents submitted for publication, each reviewer's comments were discussed and reviewers received written responses to comments when appropriate. To preserve the greatest transparency regarding potential conflicts of interest, all members of the JTFPP and the practice parameters work groups will complete a standard potential conflict of interest disclosure form, which will be available for external review by the sponsoring organization and any other interested individual. In addition, before confirming the selection of a work group chairperson, the JTFPP will discuss and resolve all relevant potential conflicts of interest associated with this selection. Finally, all members of parameter work groups will be provided a written statement regarding the importance of ensuring that the parameter development process is free of commercial bias. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifying Statements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This clinical practice guideline was designed to facilitate informed decision making on the management of adults with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR).

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All members of the Rhinitis Workgroup and the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) were required to complete a detailed declaration of interest statement, including all current and future conflicts of interest and past conflicts of interest restricted to 2 years before joining the workgroup and/or the JTFPP. It is believed that excluding all individuals with some degree of potential conflict of interest would prevent the assembly of a workgroup and the JTFPP. The authors therefore allowed members of the workgroup and the JTFPP to have past financial and/or intellectual conflicts of interest. No consequences were attached to the stated interests, but rather the authors insisted on transparency. All members of the workgroup and the JTFPP were allowed to participate in all discussions and had equal weight in formulating the statements. All were allowed equal involvement in data extraction and writing the rationales. The declaration of interest forms are available from www.allergyparameters.org and are updated on a regular basis. A summary of interests disclosed on work group members' conflict of interest disclosure statements (not including information concerning family member interests) can be found in the article's online repository and at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allergyparameters.org&quot; title=&quot;AAAAI/ACAAI Allergy Practice Parameters Web site&quot;&gt;www.allergyparameters.org&lt;/a&gt;. Completed conflict of interest disclosure statements are available on request. The JTFPP recognizes that experts in a field are likely to have interests that could come into conflict with the development of a completely unbiased and objective practice parameter. To take advantage of that expertise, a process has been developed to prevent potential conflicts from influencing the final document in a negative way. At the workgroup level, all the sections are reviewed by all workgroup members to determine whether the content is appropriate and without apparent bias. If a section is deemed to have apparent bias, it will be appropriately revised without the section author's involvement to remove potential bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
