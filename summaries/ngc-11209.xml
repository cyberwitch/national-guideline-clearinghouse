Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. &lt;strong&gt;Level A&lt;/strong&gt; is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Must&lt;/em&gt; recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. &lt;strong&gt;Level B&lt;/strong&gt; corresponds to the helping verb &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Should&lt;/em&gt; recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&amp;ndash;risk profile. Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Level C&lt;/strong&gt; corresponds to the helping verb &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;May&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level A&lt;/strong&gt; denotes a practice recommendation that &quot;must&quot; be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A &lt;strong&gt;Level B&lt;/strong&gt; indicates a recommendation that &quot;should&quot; be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A &lt;strong&gt;Level C&lt;/strong&gt; represents a recommendation that &quot;might&quot; be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a &lt;strong&gt;Level U&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Level R&lt;/strong&gt; designation is appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Level U&lt;/strong&gt; indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A &lt;strong&gt;Level R&lt;/strong&gt; is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A Level R designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non-evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The size of the intervention's effect &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The cost of the intervention &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

In November 2010, an independent librarian performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE in all languages from earliest available article to November 2010. The guideline panel performed an identical search in April 2015 to include articles published since November 2010. The following keywords were used in both the 2010 and the 2015 searches: SUDEP OR (sudden AND (unexplained OR unexpected) AND death). These were combined with the traditional medical subheadings (MeSH) for epilepsy (&quot;Epilepsy/abnormalities&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/classification&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/complications&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/drug effects&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/drug therapy&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/epidemiology&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/ethnology&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/etiology&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/genetics&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/mortality&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/physiopathology&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/prevention and control&quot; OR &quot;Epilepsy/therapy&quot;) with limits of &quot;Humans,&quot; plus &quot;All Child: 0&amp;ndash;18 years&quot; or &quot;All Adult: 19+ years.&quot; Literature types were limited to &quot;Clinical Trial, Randomized Controlled Trial, Comparative Study, Controlled Clinical Trial, Evaluation Studies, Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Research Support, N I H, Extramural, Research Support, N I H, Intramural, Research Support, Non U S Gov't, Research Support, U S Gov't, Non P H S, Research Support, U S Gov't, P H S, Validation Studies.&quot; Finally, the guideline panel specifically searched causes implicated in SUDEP (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias and preictal autonomic dysfunction) where the hypotheses were tested. See appendix e-4 in the online Data Supplement for the complete search strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two panel members working independently of each other reviewed each of the resulting 1,068 abstracts to establish whether any of the corresponding articles met the inclusion criteria (data relevant to questions, cohort, case control, case series, n &amp;gt;10). A total of 744 abstracts were excluded at this point because the corresponding articles did not include data that addressed either question, such as not addressing actual SUDEP occurrences but evaluating possible SUDEP risk factors. A total of 324 abstracts met criteria for full-text review, and their corresponding articles were reviewed. Of those, 70 articles met criteria for classification and each was classified by at least 2 GDDI committee panel members reviewing independently of each other. Reviewed articles were entered into a database application through an online questionnaire. Thirty-five articles had data for inclusion. The remaining articles were excluded because they did not have data that addressed the question or otherwise did not meet inclusion criteria, did not employ an adequate sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) definition, or did not use an appropriate epilepsy comparison group in the prognostic studies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Included articles were required to state that the sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) definition provided by Nashef 1997, Annegers 1997, and Leestma et al. 1997 was used or to describe criteria in accordance with these definitions. These definitions share the following criteria: (1) Patients had epilepsy by reasonable criteria. (2) Deaths by drowning, trauma, or status epilepticus were excluded. (3) Death could have occurred after a witnessed seizure. (4) Other competing causes of death were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guideline panel used 2 of the American Academy of Neurology's (AAN's) evidence-based schemes to rate articles: the screening criteria for the incidence question and the prognostic criteria for the risk factor question (see the &quot;Rating Scheme for the Strength of the Evidence&quot; field). Strong evidence for incidence criteria was supported by a population-representative cohort of people with epilepsy evaluated by either prospective or retrospective methods (retrospective accepted because of the objective nature of the outcome assessed), more than 80% completeness of evaluation of deaths within that cohort, and more than 80% evaluation of those deaths for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) as a cause. In these articles, the total number of patient-years of follow-up must have been provided or readily derived in order to calculate the denominator for SUDEP rates. Strong evidence for SUDEP risk factors came from studies that prospectively followed a cohort of patients with epilepsy and compared the frequency with which factors were present in cases of SUDEP vs in living persons with epilepsy. Retrospective case-control studies provided the majority of the data regarding SUDEP risk factors (Class II evidence). Because of the variability in the completeness of data in SUDEP research, SUDEP cases are categorized as definite, probable, and possible. Definite SUDEP cases meet the criteria stated previously and have a postmortem report. Probable SUDEP cases meet all the criteria stated previously but lack postmortem data. Possible SUDEP cases are those for which SUDEP cannot be ruled out but there is insufficient evidence regarding the circumstances of death, potential competing causes of death (such as presence of cardiac risk factors), and lack of an available postmortem report. Only definite and probable cases were included in this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The available literature consisted of multiple Class I articles for incidence, and therefore articles rated Class II or lower for incidence were excluded. Several Class I and many more Class II articles were available for prognostic questions. For the 2 included articles published before the accepted SUDEP definition from 1997 was established, the definition was still applied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strength of the evidence to determine final conclusions was derived according to a modified Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process. This modified GRADE process requires that the guideline panel reach agreement on whether to downgrade the evidence because of a lack of precision, consistency, generalizability, or biological plausibility, or to upgrade the evidence because of a clear dose response or a large magnitude of effect. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed for incidence studies of similar populations in order to derive summary measures when confidence intervals (CIs) for these studies were dissimilar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;div class=&quot;content_para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendations were first anchored in the strength of the conclusions and then further modulated by application of a modified Delphi process. Through this process, the recommendation levels could be dissociated to some degree from the evidence strength. For example, recommendations could be downgraded on the basis of drawbacks such as cost, patient preference, or availability of the intervention, or upgraded because of a low degree of risk in relation to benefit. Many conclusions were of sufficient strength to support counseling recommendations. Although the therapeutic classification scheme was not used because the literature search did not find any treatment trials, therapeutic recommendations were derived from risk factors that could be modified by medical intervention. The level of the therapeutic recommendation was anchored in the strength of the conclusion regarding the associated prognostic risk factor and was subject to downgrading or upgrading as just described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation. &lt;strong&gt;Level A&lt;/strong&gt; is the strongest recommendation level and is denoted by the use of the helping verb &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Must&lt;/em&gt; recommendations are rare, as they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk. &lt;strong&gt;Level B&lt;/strong&gt; corresponds to the helping verb &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Should&lt;/em&gt; recommendations tend to be more common, as the requirements are less stringent but still based on the evidence and benefit&amp;ndash;risk profile. Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Level C&lt;/strong&gt; corresponds to the helping verb &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;May&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; recommendations represent the lowest allowable recommendation level the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) considers useful within the scope of clinical practice and can accommodate the highest degree of practice variation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level A&lt;/strong&gt; denotes a practice recommendation that &quot;must&quot; be done. In almost all circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will improve health-related outcomes. A &lt;strong&gt;Level B&lt;/strong&gt; indicates a recommendation that &quot;should&quot; be done. In most circumstances, adherence to the recommendation will likely improve health-related outcomes. A &lt;strong&gt;Level C&lt;/strong&gt; represents a recommendation that &quot;might&quot; be done. In some circumstances, adherence to the recommendation might improve health-related outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When there is insufficient evidence to support an inference for the use of an intervention (i.e., the balance of benefits and harms is unknown) a &lt;strong&gt;Level U&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Level R &lt;/strong&gt;designation is appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Level U&lt;/strong&gt; indicates that the available evidence is insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of an intervention. A &lt;strong&gt;Level R&lt;/strong&gt; is assigned when the balance of benefits and harms is unknown and the intervention is known to be expensive or have important risks. A Level R designates that the intervention should not be used outside of a research setting. Non-evidence-based factors that need to be transparently and systematically considered when formulating recommendations include the following: &lt;/p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The relative value of the benefit as compared with the risk; this is derived from consideration of:&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The importance to patients of the health related-outcomes (both benefits and harms) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The size of the intervention's effect &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;li&gt;The risk of harm of the intervention (i.e., tolerability and safety) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The feasibility of complying with the intervention (e.g., the intervention's availability) &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The cost of the intervention &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

      <FieldValue Value="&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style-type: disc;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;It seems reasonable to infer that improved control of an individual's generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) will result in a reduced risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Thus, a reduction in SUDEP risk is an additional benefit to the many benefits resulting from improved seizure control. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;People with epilepsy and their families prefer to be informed of the individual's risk for a catastrophic event such as SUDEP, even when the probability of the event is low. After being informed of an adverse event, people commonly overestimate the risk of that adverse event happening to them. Such overestimation unduly increases anxiety related to an adverse event. Overestimation can be lessened by presenting the risk as the probability of both having and not having the event, and by using numbers in addition to words and frequencies rather than percentages to convey the risk. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;The presence in the bedroom of another individual at least 10 years of age and of normal intelligence is associated with a decreased SUDEP risk. If it were in accordance with patient and family circumstances and values, nocturnal supervision could reduce SUDEP risk. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Patients are especially interested in factors that might reduce their risk even when a causal link between the factor and a reduction in risk has not been established. Knowledge of these risk factors might suggest behaviors that could modify the risk factors (e.g., improved therapy adherence), increase the person's sense of control, and reduce the anxiety that comes from awareness of the risk. &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;" />

Conflict of interest forms were obtained from all authors and reviewed by an oversight committee prior to project initiation. AAN and AES limit the participation of authors with substantial conflicts of interest.
